<p><strong>Taking the bus</strong></p>
<p>The bus is the most practical means of transport for anyone who lives in Bologna. In Bologna there are no trams or underground system. The bus will take you to any part of town or even the province. TPER (<em>Trasporto Passeggeri Emilia-Romagna</em>), the company that runs the large network of the city and provincial bus routes, carries more than 340,000 passengers every day. In the city network alone there are around seventy buses. There are also extra-urban coaches that will take you out of the city. The coaches are usually blue (not red and orange like the urban buses), have longer routes and make less stops. Shuttle buses are smaller and travel mainly round the city centre. Central station and Marconi airport are connected by the Aerobus service.</p>
<p>You can check the routes and timetables of all lines quickly and reliably on the website or use the Tper app on your smartphone. Type in the departure point (road, stop, part of the city, etc.), the time and the arrival point.</p>
<p>There are different solutions for the tickets: hourly (valid for 75 minutes), daily, a ten-trip ticket and subscriptions. Check out the solution that suits you best. The tickets (also called &lsquo;titoli di viaggio&rsquo;) can be purchased at the tobacconists or newsagents, or at the TPER sales outlets. In most cases you can also buy a ticket on the bus, but you must have the right change. University of Bologna students aged under 30 can buy tickets at a discounted price.</p>

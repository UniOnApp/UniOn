<p><strong>Rules to follow on the bus</strong></p>
<p>On the bus you will find signs telling you what to do. Some are simple rules for good manners, others depend on the local habits. For example, where you are waiting for the bus at the stop, let the driver on the bus coming that you want to get on. Just stick your hand out. This is important above all when you are the only one at the stop. If no passengers on board press the &ldquo;stop&rdquo; button and the driver doesn't see you, he may simply slow down without stopping. <br /> The buses are often crowded. It is a good idea to have your ticket ready before you get on. You have to stamp the ticket in the special machine.

Getting your ticket ready before you get on is also a sign of prudence. You also have to watch out for pickpockets who may take advantage of your distraction when you open your bag to take out your purse or wallet. There are usually two stamping machines: one near the front entrance and one near the rear.

Once you are on board, move down to the centre of the bus to make room for the people getting on after you.

Some seats are reserved for the elderly, pregnant women or persons with young children, or the disabled.

If you sit in a reserved seat, if you see anyone getting on the bus who needs it more than you it is good manners to let them sit down.
Do not talk to the driver unless it is necessary and then only for a short time. Book your stop promptly, pressing one of the red buttons.

Always take care of your bag and wallet, and if you have an hourly ticket check that it is valid.</p>

<p><strong>Itineraries on foot</strong></p>
<p>Another way of visiting Bologna on foot is to follow a thematic itinerary. In Bologna it is hard to find a road or district devoted purely to shopping, food and wine or culture. In fact, alongside the different shops, restaurants and pubs, you will find churches, monuments, squares, towers and parks on every corner. The city centre has around 5,400 buildings, and 4,500 of these are recognised for their historical and cultural value.</p>
<p>An interesting and alternative way of walking round Bologna is to follow one of the thematic itineraries. Via the Bologna Welcome service, the municipality has developed a number of itineraries: Famous People, Water, Motors, Green areas and Industrial Archaeology, as well as the more classic Cultural itinerary (visiting Churches, Squares, Monuments and Museums).</p>
<p>The famous people itinerary will introduce you to the places frequented by the scientist Guglielmo Marconi, the painter Giorgio Morandi, the singer-songwriter Lucio Dalla and the intellectual Pier Paolo Pasolini.</p>
<p>And if you walk down via D&rsquo;Azeglio, every evening around 6 p.m. you will hear a song by Lucio Dalla, played through the loudspeakers near his house. Lucio Dalla is a famous singer-songwriter from Bologna who died in 2012.</p>
<p>The Water itinerary takes you to the Fountain of Neptune, the symbol of Bologna, the Jewish Ghetto, and to the Canale delle Moline, where in some stretches the water still flows fast. At the Canale delle Moline, you can see a much-loved and much-photographed window, the Finestrella di via Piella.</p>

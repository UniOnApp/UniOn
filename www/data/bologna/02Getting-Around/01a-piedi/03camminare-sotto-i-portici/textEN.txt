<p><strong>Walking under the Porticoes</strong></p>
<p>The Porticoes are undoubtedly one of Bologna's very special features. Running for around 40 km, they have been nominated as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.</p>
<p>In addition to their beauty and national and international architectural uniqueness, they shelter us from the rain, the sun and the passing cars and motorbikes. In Bologna many people leave the house without an umbrella, even when it&rsquo;s raining, as they can walk in the shelter of the porticoes. Under the porticoes you can only walk on foot; bicycles must be pushed.</p>
<p>The Porticoes have very different histories and characteristics: the &ldquo;quadriportico&rdquo; at the Basilica of S.Maria dei Servi in Strada Maggiore, designed in the late 14<sup>th</sup> century, is the city&rsquo;s widest. The highest portico in via Altabella reaches a height of 10 metres. The narrowest portico, measuring just 95 centimetres, is in via Senzanome, behind the city walls. The city&rsquo;s most famous and the longest in the world starts in Via Saragozza and continues as far as the Sanctuary of the Madonna di San Luca. It has 664 arches (some say 666!) and runs for 3.796 km. The hillside stretch of the portico starts at the Arco del Meloncello. From the Arco del Meloncello it begins to climb up to the Sanctuary of San Luca. Catholic and other traditions state that walking up to San Luca is a &lsquo;sacrifice&rsquo;, to make a wish come true or to give thanks for a grace received.</p>
<p>In the second half of the 16<sup>th</sup> century the famous portico dell&rsquo;Archiginnasio was built, known as the &lsquo;Portico del Pavaglione&rsquo; which also hosts the Palazzo dell&rsquo;Archiginnasio.</p>
<p>Even though &ldquo;in 1288 a Statute of the Municipality of Bologna established that all new houses had to be built with a brick portico&rdquo;, in Bologna there are still eight wooden porticoes (the one at Casa Isolani in Strada Maggiore, of Casa Grassi in via Marsala and Casa Rampionesi in via del Carro).</p>

<p><strong>Wandering around Bologna</strong></p>
<p>Anyone who knows Bologna says it is a human-sized city. What does this mean? Human-sized means that it is suited to everyone&rsquo;s needs, because of its size and characteristics. </p>
<p>In just one day you can walk around all the main districts of the city centre. For example, it takes around a quarter of an hour on foot to get from Central Station to Piazza Maggiore. And around ten minutes from Piazza Maggiore to Piazza Santo Stefano. It takes slightly longer to get from Piazza Maggiore to Meloncello, where you can go up to San Luca: around twenty minutes on foot.</p>
<p>It is very pleasant to walk around Bologna: there are lots of pedestrian areas, streets where you can only go on foot or by bicycle. Cars, motorbikes and buses cannot enter the pedestrian areas. Among the most interesting pedestrian areas you will find the first stretch of via D&rsquo;Azeglio, the Quadrilatero (around Via Clavature and via Pescherie Vecchie), a part of Via Oberdan, a part of Via del Pratello, and a number of squares (Piazza Minghetti, Piazza Santo Stefano, Piazza Verdi, Piazza San Domenico, etc.).</p>
<p>At the weekends and on public holidays, the so-called &ldquo;T&rdquo; zone of Bologna, including Via dell&rsquo;Indipendenza, Via Rizzoli and Via Ugo Bassi, is open only to pedestrians and bicycles. It is called &ldquo;T&rdquo; because where these three roads meet it forms an upturned T. At the weekends thousands of people stroll freely in the middle of the road. Making the &ldquo;T&rdquo; in Bologna pedestrian also brought a great change to the landscape the local people were used to. No buses, cars and motorbikes revealed a new image of the city. The recent photos of these areas remind us of the 50s and 60s, before cars and traffic hit the area. Even in the areas open to traffic, the porticoes along the streets make walking around Bologna a pleasant and safer experience (read more in &lsquo;Walking under the Porticoes&rsquo;).</p>
<p>Finally, at some of the busier junctions, the traffic lights have a <em>count-down</em> device. To cross the pedestrian crossing at the junction, press the button on the traffic light pole. After pressing the button, the traffic light turns yellow and as you cross the count-down tells you how much time you have to cross the road.</p>

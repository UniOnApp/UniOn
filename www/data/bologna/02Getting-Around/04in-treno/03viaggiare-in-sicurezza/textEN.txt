<p><strong>Travelling in safety</strong></p>
<p>Trains are the safest means of transport. However you should be aware of some rules of conduct. In the station and on the trains you will find signs telling you what to do, or not to do, to act safely.</p>
<p>Let's have a look at some of these:</p>
<p><strong>Do not cross the yellow line</strong></p>

<p>The yellow line indicates the safety distance from the tracks and the transiting trains. Do not get too close to the line as it could be dangerous.</p>
<p><strong>Do not jump on a leaving train</strong></p>

<p>It is forbidden to try and get on the train if the staff (controller, train manager) are already on board. Do not try to open the doors if the train has already started moving.</p>
<p><strong>Get off the train only once it has completely stopped in the station</strong></p>

<p>It is forbidden to open the doors and get off the train if it is moving.</p>
<p><strong>Get off on the &ldquo;right&rdquo; side</strong></p>

<p>Make sure that the door opens onto the platform and not the track.</p>
<p><strong>Listen to the messages given over the loudspeakers and keep an eye on the timetable boards.</strong></p>

<p>Pay attention to the loudspeaker messages and read any notices given on the boards and monitors. You can check the train times, see if they are on time and check the platform.</p>
<p><strong>Do not throw things out of the windows. </strong></p>

<p>Do not throw anything out of the window: it is dangerous and not at all environmentally friendly.</p>
<p><strong>Do not lean out of the windows </strong></p>

<p>There are poles, pylons, tunnel walls, trees and other trains along the route. Leaning out of the window can be very dangerous.</p>

<p>On the track: to make getting on the train easier, stand near the monitor indicating your carriage number. Then before you get on the train, make sure everyone who needs to has got off. Finally, if you have a paper ticket, remember to validate it. To validate your ticket, stamp it in one of the machines. You will find the machines in the hall, in the underpass and on the platforms. In Italian there are a number of terms to describe this: &ldquo;vidimare&rdquo; or &ldquo;obliterare&rdquo; a ticket; they are more specific, but used less often than &ldquo;timbrare&rdquo;. Always listen to the messages given over the loudspeaker. They may inform of a platform change, a delay or simply that a train is arriving.</p>

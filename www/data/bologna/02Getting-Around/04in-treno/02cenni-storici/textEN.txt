<p><strong>History</strong></p>
<p>The history of Bologna station dates back to the mid-1800s. On 21 July 1859 the Bologna-Piacenza line opened and in 1864, when the fifth line was built to Pistoia, Bologna station became the main rail hub between Northern and Southern Italy.</p>
<p>The station, designed by architect Gaetano Ratti, has a regular layout and was built in the style of early Florentine Renaissance, &lsquo;with ashlar walls&rsquo;, and the clock tower, which was bombed during the Second World War and was never rebuilt&rdquo;. Ratti's design inspired other smaller stations in Italy. It was officially inaugurated in 1871 (some sources say 1876).</p>
<p>&ldquo;A number of extensions, including the construction in 1926 of the west wing (piazzale ovest) for the new head tracks and in 1934 of the east wing, together with the post-war alterations, have altered its layout and appearance&rdquo;. In recent times the station has been almost completely redeveloped and modernised. The new underground station for High Speed trains, accessible directly from Via de&rsquo; Carracci, opened in 2013.</p>
<p>One very famous tragic event hit Bologna station on 2 August 1980: &lsquo;The Bologna massacre&rsquo;, defined as the &ldquo;largest Italian massacre in peace time&rdquo;. &ldquo;On 10.25 a.m. of 2 August 1980 time stood still: 23 kilos of dynamite exploded in the second class waiting room at the railway station. The hands of the large clock still mark that time, and that season of death and mystery, today&rdquo;.</p>
<p>This terrorist attack triggered one of the most difficult investigations in Italian police history. Since 1980, every year, on 2 August events are held in commemoration in Bologna. The commemoration still sees the participation of very many people from all over Italy.</p>

<p><strong>Getting around by bike</strong></p>
<p>Bologna is a &ldquo;bicycle friendly&rdquo; city. In the past few years the Municipality has promoted the use of bikes in the city. Travelling by bicycle does not pollute, reduces the traffic and is good for your health </p>
<p>The urban network of cycle paths is around 140 kilometres long and linked the city centre with the outlying districts with twelve different routes. Travelling by bicycle on the cycle paths is safer because you zkeep out of the way of car and bus traffic. For example, route 8 (Santa Viola) links Central Station, at Piazza XX Settembre, to the roads along Via Emilia Ponente. Route 7 (Dozza) links the Navile ai Viali district with the city centre. Signposts indicate points of interest along the cycle paths (green areas, parks, monuments, etc.) as well as hazardous junctions. The Municipality of Bologna (Urban Mobility desk) makes available a detailed map of all <a href="http://www.comune.bologna.it/trasporti/servizi/2:3026/3293/">cycle paths</a> in the city centre and outlying districts.</p>
<p>Bologna also boasts a Bicycle Ringroad: a tree-lined ring of cycle paths 8.4 km long, which runs along the Viali around the city centre (viale Carducci, viale Panzacchi, viale Aldini, viale Pepoli, viale Vicini, viale Silvani, viale Pietramellara, viale Ercolani, viale Filopanti).</p>
<p>If you have just arrived in Bologna and don't know how to get around, you can take part in a lesson at <a href="https://salvaiciclisti.bologna.it/progetti/unibike">UniBike</a>, the University of the Bicycle, to learn rules and tips on how to get around Bologna easily and safely, where to buy a bicycle, how to prevent it from getting stolen and so on.</p>
<p>If you enjoy <a href="http://www.piste-ciclabili.com/comune-bologna#map=44.35449,11.546433/10">bicycle touring</a>, travelling by bicycle through nature, there are many itineraries outside the city, towards the hills, the woods and lakes of the Tuscan-Emilian Apennines and other towns in the province. This is a great opportunity for doing sport and visiting interesting cultural and natural places. </p>

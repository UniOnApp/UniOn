<p><strong>Take care on your bike!</strong> </p>
<p>&ldquo;Travelling by bicycle is a mix of technique and freedom&rdquo;, wrote the Bolognese urban designer Pierluigi Cervellati: &ldquo;we use our skills, our senses, our memory and at the same time we do sport and have fun&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Going by bicycle safely demands attention both in and outside the city. Your bicycle must work well, there must be no technical problems. At the same time, it is important to know the Highway code and use strategies to avoid hazards which could put our health at risk. Finally, we must watch out for thefts.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s have a look at a few suggestions: the Highway code says that bicycles must have a brake on each wheel, a bell, a white or yellow light (at the front) ,a red light (at the rear), a pair of reflectors on the pedals and on the sides of the wheels and a red reflector on the back (see picture). Check that your bike has all of these. Then, check that the tyres are at the correct pressure, not too much and not too little. Does the front brake work? What about the back one? The brakes must both work. The wheels must not wobble and the pedals must turn smoothly. If you have any doubts, take your bicycle to a mechanic or bike workshop.</p>
<p>While pedalling, always use your common sense and follow the highway code: keep to the right, and watch out for any cars on your left which could turn right without seeing you. Make sure you are always visible and watch out for doors opening and people getting out of parked cars. Keep a safe distance. Remember to signal you are turning left or right. In Italy we stick our arm out to signal.</p>
<p>Always keep one hand on the handlebars and make sure you can be seen and heard. Safety helmets are not mandatory for cyclists in Italy but are very useful.</p>
<p>Finally, always chain your bicycle to something (pole, bike rack, etc.) preferably in a well-lit and visible place, and with two different padlocks, even if you only leave it there for a few minutes. Bicycle thieves are professionals and are just waiting for you to be distracted.</p>

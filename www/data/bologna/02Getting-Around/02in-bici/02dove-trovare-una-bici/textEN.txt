<p><strong>Where can I find a bike?</strong></p>
<p>There are numerous possibilities for getting a bicycle in Bologna. First you have to decide whether to buy or hire one. It depends what use you make of it. If you want to buy one, you can get a cheaper, second-hand one or buy a new bicycle. However, always take care where you leave it and always remember to lock it up safely, because bicycles get stolen very often in Bologna.</p>
<p>You too, sooner or later, will get an offer to buy a stolen bicycle. Unfortunately this black market is very active, particularly around the university. Never trust anyone who offers you a cheap bike in via Zamboni or elsewhere in the centre. It is illegal to buy a stolen bike. To fight the black market of stolen bikes, there are many interesting initiatives. These include the traditional used bike auction, where you can buy a bike for between 25 and 60 &euro;. The bidder with the most imagination who can attract the vendor&rsquo;s attention by doing something entertaining or eccentric usually wins the auction. This event is held in Bologna eight times a year.</p>
<p>Along with some &ldquo;bike loving&rdquo; associations, the Municipality of Bologna runs several initiatives to promote bike use. For example, with the <a href="http://www.comune.bologna.it/trasporti/servizi/2:3026/3295/">&ldquo;C&rsquo;entro in Bici&rdquo;</a> service you can hire public bicycles free of charge. You just have to pay a small deposit and sign up for the bike-sharing service. University of Bologna students can register at discounted conditions. Consult the roads and places where you can <a href="http://www.tper.it/car-e-bike-sharing/elenco-rastrelliere-centro-bici">pick up a bicycle</a>. At the &ldquo;Amici della bici&rdquo; points, cyclists in Bologna can pump up their tyres free of charge, or consult the new services and initiatives promoted by the local administration. Dynamo (dynamo.bo.it) is a bike station in Bologna, beneath the monumental Pincio staircase, near the Rail and Bus stations. Here students can hire a bicycle, use the guarded parking area and take advantage of the bicycle workshop services. All at reduced prices.</p>

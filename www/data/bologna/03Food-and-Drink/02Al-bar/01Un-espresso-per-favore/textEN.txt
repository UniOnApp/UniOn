<p><strong>Un espresso per favore</strong></p>
<p>Italians love to customise their coffee in the most imaginative ways. Only a few clients order a simple espresso. In Italy baristas receive a whole range of requests, from long coffee in a large cup, to foamy coffee with a dash of cocoa powder to &ldquo;corrected&rdquo; coffee. Let&rsquo;s have a look at the most common coffees.</p>
<p>Caff&egrave; lungo or alto contains more caffeine than caff&egrave; ristretto or corto and there is more coffee in the cup. A little milk is added to caff&egrave; macchiato caldo (hot milk) or macchiato freddo (cold milk). If you ask for a caff&egrave; macchiato caldo, the milk is whipped into a foam like the milk in cappuccino. If you like very thick milk foam you can also ask for a caff&egrave; schiumato.</p>
<p>Those with a sweet tooth might ask for coffee with cream (panna), often served in a large cup, possibly with a sprinkling of cocoa or cinnamon.</p>
<p>Some like their coffee without sugar, for others adding sugar is essential for enjoying all the flavour: there is white sugar, or cane sugar (raw sugar), honey, or sweetener, which has fewer calories. Usually sugar, sweetener and honey are served in sachets you will find on the counter.</p>
<p>To avoid the side-effects of caffeine and avoid staying awake, you could order a caff&egrave; decaffeinato or a caff&egrave; d&rsquo;orzo (barley). Barley coffee is coffee only in colour: in fact it is a kind of infusion of barley, a totally caffeine-free cereal.</p>
<p>The more daring may enjoy a caff&egrave; corretto, a coffee with a drop of liqueur, perhaps grappa, sambuca or other distilled liqueurs, and finally, when it&rsquo;s hot outside, you may order a caff&egrave; freddo shakerato (cold shaken coffee).</p>

<p><strong>Pasta and cappuccino. And a duty stamp.</strong></p>
<p>There are many types of caf&eacute; in Bologna (and Italy). From the most elegant where you can sit comfortably and have colazione (breakfast), perhaps while enjoying the beauty of a historical caf&eacute; (see also &lsquo;Some of the historical caf&eacute;s in Bologna&rsquo;), or a cup of tea with some biscuits, to the bar-tobacconists where, in addition to a coffee you can also buy a duty stamp or a pack of cigarettes. In some caf&eacute;s you can also watch a football match or play cards. </p>
<p>But what do people mostly do at the caf&eacute;s? The most typical breakfast is a pasta and a cappuccino. Some people prefer a simple coffee or a cup of tea, a freshly squeezed orange juice or fruit juice or a hot chocolate instead of a cappuccino.</p>
<p>The paste, cakes, also known as <em>brioche </em>or <em>cornetti</em>, are filled with cream, jam, honey, nutella, etc. And if you have a really sweet tooth, you might go for a cream doughnut. Increasingly often you might find a vegan alternative, without any ingredients of animal origin.</p>
<p>And for a savoury snack, caf&eacute;s usually offer a range of pizzas and sandwiches.</p>
<p>Having coffee at the caf&eacute; is in any case a habit that Italians refuse to do without: <a href="http://www.irpinianews.it/caffe-al-bar-unabitudine-a-cui-gli-italiani-non-rinunciano/">in 2016 a study published by the FIPE</a> (Italian Federation of Public Traders) stated that coffee, and cappuccino, at a caf&eacute; produces a turnover of around 6.6 billion EUR, with an average cost of 1.07 EUR in northern Italy and 0.74 EUR in the south.</p>

<p><strong>&ldquo;Il caff&egrave; sospeso&rdquo; - Suspended coffee</strong></p>
<p>A widespread tradition in Bologna is the &ldquo;caff&egrave; sospeso&rdquo;, even though the origins are Neapolitan and date back to the mid-1800s, when coffee was still a luxury that few could afford.</p>
<p>&ldquo;When a person from Naples is happy for some reason, rather than just paying for one coffee he drinks himself he pays for two, one for himself and one for the next customer. It&rsquo;s like offering a coffee to the rest of the world&rdquo;, wrote Luciano De Crescenzo in his book <a href="https://www.ibs.it/caffe-sospeso-saggezza-quotidiana-in-libro-luciano-de-crescenzo/e/9788804679509"><em>Il caff&egrave; sospeso. Saggezza quotidiana in piccoli sorsi</em></a>.</p>
<p>It means paying for a coffee for someone less fortunate than yourself. It works like this: if you want, you leave the receipt of the coffee you have already paid for at the bar. It&rsquo;s a small gift for someone who can't afford it. The barista at &lsquo;Caff&egrave; dell&rsquo;Accademia&rsquo; in via Guerrazzi told us this: &ldquo;Our main customer is Pasquale, a tramp who lives here in via Guerrazzi, but sometimes pensioners drop in, glad to get a free coffee&rdquo;.</p>

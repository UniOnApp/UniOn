<p><strong>Some historical caf&eacute;s in Bologna</strong></p>
<p><strong>Caff&egrave; Pasticceria</strong> <a href="http://www.gamberini.eu/"><strong>Gamberini</strong></a>:</p>
<p>&ldquo;For over a century, this institution has been serving refined sweet and savoury delights. The name behind the memorable banquets seen in films like <a href="http://www.mymovies.it/film/1975/amicimiei/trailer/">Monicelli's &ldquo;My friends&rdquo;</a>, it has always been frequented by all social classes and is a legend among the people of Bologna because it served hot brioches and cakes even from the side door, where many people stood in line. Intimate and elegant, with just a few tables under the porticoes, many of the original furnishings can be found today, in a good state of conservation.</p>
<p><strong>Caff&egrave;</strong> <a href="http://antoniazzi.biz/barcaffe/caffe-zanarini"><strong>Zanarini</strong></a><strong>: </strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;The bar of the Archiginnasio, a symbol of Bolognese elegance, at the will of Pope Pius IV.<br /> Caff&egrave; Zanarini is a historical name for the people of Bologna, and was founded in 1930 as a bar-patisserie which over the decades reached its acclaim due to the quality of its products and services. In the past few years it has changed hands several times, and today its renewed splendour is thanks to the management of the Antoniazzi group. At Zanarini you can have breakfast, enjoy one of the best coffees in Bologna, or have lunch and even dinner, choosing from a range of the highest quality products from the tradition of Bologna and beyond&rdquo;.</p>
<p><strong>Caff&egrave;</strong> <a href="http://www.caffeterzibologna.com/en/"><strong>Terzi</strong></a><br /> &ldquo;Located in Via Oberdan right in the city centre, Caff&egrave; Terzi was established in 2002 but immediately became one of the favourite locations of the people of Bologna. Here, coffee and other drinks are served in surroundings dominated by Venetian style stuccoes. Here you can taste a rare selection of original coffees from Indonesia, Ethiopia, Colombia and India. As well as a wide range of pastries made exclusively with only the highest quality yeasts, you can enjoy some rare delights, including the &ldquo;caff&egrave; Cremino&rdquo;: three layers of coffee, cream and milk, served in parfait cups. Terzi is famous for its summer creams made from amaretto, orange and cinnamon, and its unmissable iced coffees with zabaione, hazelnut, cinnamon and cr&egrave;me br&ucirc;l&eacute;e&rdquo;.</p>

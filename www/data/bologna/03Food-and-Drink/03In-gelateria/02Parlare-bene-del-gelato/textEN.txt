<p>&ldquo;Makes you lose your mind&rdquo;</p>
<p>You just don't know which one to choose! A thousand creative and tasty flavours, to make your taste buds go crazy! Not to be missed!</p>
<p>&ldquo;Best gelateria in Bologna&rdquo;</p>
<p>Simply sensational, perhaps a little overpriced but it&rsquo;s worth it. I recommend the bacio, and particularly the hazelnut.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Gelateria artigianale&rdquo;</p>
<p>Excellent artisanal gelateria with natural ingredients. You can enjoy your ice cream sitting outside in front of the gelateria.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Simply the best ice cream in the world&rdquo;</p>
<p>I live in Bologna and stop in here at least once a week. Incredible, original flavours, I really recommend it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Excellent gelateria &rdquo;</p>
<p>Excellent flavours, the creams are really creamy :-). I tried the Cremino Guglielmo and I must say it was an excellent choice. I had a small cup, but both the quality and the quantity are high. I&rsquo;ll certainly come back and try some other flavours.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Superlative ice cream&rdquo;</p>
<p>Cordiality and courtesy, the ice cream is superlative, the owner has been making ice cream for 50 years and still makes it like the old times. I recommend the strawberry ripple, it&rsquo;s delicious!!!! But both the fruit flavours and the creams are really nice. The gelateria is small and a bit old fashioned but the quality more than makes up for it.</p>

<p><strong>How many flavours do you want?</strong></p>
<p>Ice cream is delicious in any season. In Bologna the gelaterie are open all year round. The most popular ice creams are artisanal, made with milk, cream and eggs. There are many flavours: from the classics: milk, hazelnut, chocolate, bacio, cream, vanilla, stracciatella, lemon, coconut, strawberry, yoghurt, pistachio, spagnola (etc.), to the most imaginative, including &lsquo;pumpkin and cinnamon&rsquo;, &lsquo;figs and jasmine&rsquo;, liquorice, &lsquo;marrons glac&eacute;s&rsquo;. Every ice cream maker has his own speciality, there are very many of them, so there is no point in trying to list all the flavours here.</p>
<p>The classic flavours can usually be found in all the gelaterias. For example, stracciatella is cream with chocolate chips, bacio is hazelnut and chocolate cream, spagnola is milk ice cream with cherries.</p>
<p>Everyone has their preference: fruits or tasty creams, served in cones or cups, which only in Bologna are also known as cestina. You eat an ice cream cup with a spoon, or rather a coloured plastic palette. A cup may be made of wafer, paper or plastic. Cones on the other hand are always made from crispy wafer. If you sit at a table, you may order an ice cream cup perhaps served with fruit, cream or decorated with paper umbrellas.</p>
<p>You could take a pleasant surprise to your friends or relatives, in the form of an ice cream tub (vaschetta); you can get one weighing half a kilo, a kilo or more. Ice cream can be kept in the freezer for up to a few weeks.</p>
<p>The cost of a kilo of ice cream varies but is not usually less than 20 EUR. While an ice cream with two flavours costs 2 EUR or more.</p>
<p>At the gelateria you can also purchase other tasty things: fruit ice lollies, a warm focaccia with ice cream, sorbets, granita, ice cream cakes and many other things that will make you lick your lips.</p>
<p>More and more often you can find ice cream &ldquo;free of&rdquo; milk, eggs, sugar (for lactose-intolerant people or those who are watching their figure) and even gluten-free ice cream.</p>
<p>As the warm season arrives, in spring and summer in Bologna you will find the so-called &lsquo;baracchine&rsquo; opening, gelaterias that open only in some periods of the year with tables outside, often in the parks.</p>

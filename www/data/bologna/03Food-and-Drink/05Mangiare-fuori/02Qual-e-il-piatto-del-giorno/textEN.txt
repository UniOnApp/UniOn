<p><strong>What&rsquo;s the dish of the day? </strong></p>
<p>Every restaurant has its own style: some are more rustic, or atmospheric, or specialise in fish or meat, there are pizzeria-restaurants, ethnic restaurants.... the more the merrier!. And of course, prices vary greatly too. In the trattorias you can eat well spending little over 20 EUR, while the more famous restaurants will cost you a small fortune. Compared to restaurants, trattorias are usually simpler serving home-made food (the name comes from <em>traiteur</em>, the host) even though today there is increasingly less difference between the two.</p>
<p>In a restaurant the menu lists different courses: antipasti, first courses (rice and pasta) second courses (meat or fish), side dishes and desserts. The wine list is generally separate. Wines may be white, red or ros&eacute;. In some less formal restaurants, house wine can be ordered in a carafe (from a quarter of a litre to a litre), or by the glass, while in other restaurants you have to order a bottle, which is often more expensive. Local wines include Pignoletto, Lambrusco, Sangiovese and Albana.</p>
<p>Antipastos are used to whet the appetite. They are usually served in small portions before the so-called &lsquo;primo piatto&rsquo;. In Italy the &lsquo;primi&rsquo; are usually pasta, risotto or possibly soup. Second courses on the other hand are generally meat or fish dishes. The side dishes include raw or cooked vegetables, roast potatoes or French fries. Bolognese culinary traditions also include crescentine and tigelle as antipasti or second courses, served with sliced meats, cheeses (including the typical squacquerone) and sottaceti (vegetables preserved in vinegar).</p>
<p>You can order &lsquo;alla carta&rsquo;, by choosing any dish in the menu (some restaurants offer a &ldquo;dish of the day&rdquo;) or, if it is available, you may choose a &lsquo;men&ugrave; fisso&rsquo;, a set menu. Set menus usually cost less than eating alla carta, but the choice of dishes is more limited.</p>
<p>In Italian restaurants you will generally pay a &lsquo;coperto&rsquo;, cover charge, a fixed amount paid by every customer for the service and bread.</p>
<p>Lovers of the good life, the Bolognese people go out to lunch and dinner every day of the week. However restaurants are usually full during the weekends and on Sunday lunch. So remember to phone early to book a table.</p>

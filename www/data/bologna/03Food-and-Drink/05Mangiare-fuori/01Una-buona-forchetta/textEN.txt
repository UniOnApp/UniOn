<p><strong>Food lovers in Bologna</strong></p>
<p>Eating out is very much a consolidated Italian habit, and in Bologna there&rsquo;s plenty to choose from. Food lovers are spoiled for choice, at lunch or dinner: restaurants serving traditional cuisine, family run trattorias, ethnic restaurants and all sorts of <em>osteria</em>.</p>
<p>Bologna, a key destination for Italian food and wine tourism, is renowned throughout the world for the quality and flavour of its typical dishes. Not by chance, alongside the nicknames <em>La Dotta</em> and <em>la Rossa</em>, the city is also known as <em>la Grassa</em>, precisely for the abundance of its food.</p>
<p>Traditional Bolognese cuisine is based on pork and egg pasta, whether artisanal or home-made. The &lsquo;sfogline&rsquo; are the women who roll out the sfoglia (pasta) with a rolling pin, as tradition demands, and compete with each other to see who can prepare the thinnest pasta for tortellini, lasagne and tagliatelle.</p>
<p>Tagliatelle, tortellini and lasagne are strictly made with egg pasta and the rag&ugrave; sauce is made with pork, mortadella (in other regions this is also known as &lsquo;la Bologna&rsquo;) and beef. Tortellini are served in broth or with cream. Tradition demands that the broth be made from hens, or even better, capon. Traditional lasagne are green because spinach is added to the mixture. They are mixed with layers of roux sauce, rag&ugrave; and plenty of Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese. Some classic Bolognese recipes are protected, and deposited with the Chamber of Commerce, Industry, Trade and Agriculture of Bologna thanks to the <strong>&lsquo;</strong>Delegazione dell'Accademia Italiana della Cucina&rsquo;. The aim is to safeguard the authenticity of this culinary tradition.</p>
<p>Think nothing of the &lsquo;Bolognese sauce&rsquo; or &lsquo;il rag&ugrave;&rsquo; you find in European and international restaurants. These imitations have nothing to do with the original recipes.</p>
<p>If you are hungry but don't fancy Bolognese cooking, in Bologna you can count on a wide selection of ethnic restaurants: Chinese and Japanese, Greek or African (Ethiopian, for example), Brazilian, Indian, Iranian, Egyptian.</p>

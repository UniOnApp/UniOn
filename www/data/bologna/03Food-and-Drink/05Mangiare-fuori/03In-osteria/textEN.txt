<p><strong>At the osteria</strong></p>
<p>What better place than the Osteria to meet with friends over a drink?</p>
<p>In Bologna, in the 1300s there were more than one hundred and fifty osterias. Over the centuries the Osterias changed, many becoming places to socialise open to all, similar to restaurants, trattorias or wine bars (enoteca). Originally, particularly in the mid-1900s, they were rustic places open mostly in the evening and frequented by men, drinking wine and other alcoholic drinks and chatting together. Today, although they have kept their rustic, traditional features in terms of both cuisine and furnishing, the osterias are frequented by students and workers of all ages, to have a drink, an aperitif or an evening meal.</p>
<p>A trend in Italy today is the &ldquo;apericena&rdquo;, a neologism describing the habit of meeting up in the late afternoon, after work, to have an aperitif and a bite to eat, without spending much. Many osterias do not accept bookings; the atmosphere is relaxed and informal, and you often share a table with other people you don't know.</p>
<p>In Bologna there are <a href="http://www.lettera43.it/it/articoli/viaggi/2013/03/08/bologna-e-ancora-vera-nelle-sue-osterie/194046/">very many Osterias</a> you can honour with your presence: Da Vito, Broccaindosso, Osteria dell&rsquo;Orsa, Dal nonno, Osteria Da Mario, Il Moretto, Al cappello rosso, etc.</p>
<p>These are just a few of the many historical osterias in Bologna. So you must find out about them and choose the one that is most to your liking (why not consult the &lsquo;Mangiarozzo&rsquo; which lists the osterias and trattorias in Italy).</p>
<p>Unforgettable for its fame, history and originality, the Osteria del Sole is a historical location dating back to 1465, just a stone&rsquo;s throw from Piazza Maggiore, in vicolo dei Ranocchi 1/d. Famoust for its speciality of &ldquo;only drink, if you want to eat bring it with you&rdquo;, the osteria continues to attract people from all over the world. The osteria sells only wine, no water, and if you want to eat something you can bring it from home or buy it in one of the shops nearby.</p>

<p><strong>The canteen</strong></p>
<p>Originally, the Italian word <em>mensa</em> meant a table laid out with food. Today the <em>mensa</em> is a type of restaurant reserved for some categories of people. A company canteen, for example, prepares meals for the workers in a company, a school canteen for schoolchildren, and the university canteen for students and staff of a university.</p>
<p>It works like a self-service restaurant: take a tray and paper napkin, cutlery, a glass and then queue up to order whatever dishes you like, from starters to dessert. Then go to the cash desk and pay your bill. Usually you have to show your badge at the cash desk, and you can also pay with meal vouchers.</p>
<p>When you have finished your meal, remember to clear the table and place your tray in the containers.</p>
<p>The university canteens are very crowded at rush hour. At lunch from 12.00 to 2.00 p.m. you will probably have to queue.</p>
<p>There is always a wide range of menus to choose from. If you are very hungry, you can choose a complete meal, with a rice or pasta dish, a second course, side dish, dessert and coffee.</p>
<p>There are four <a href="http://www.unibo.it/it/servizi-e-opportunita/borse-di-studio-e-agevolazioni/mense-universitarie-punti-ristoro-e-servizi-di-ristorazione-convenzionati-a-bologna">University of Bologna canteens</a>: <em>Bononia University</em> <em>Restaurant</em>, the Engineering Department, the &lsquo;Scuderia&rsquo; and La Veneta canteens. The University of Bologna has also opened some other food outlets reserved exclusively for university students. These places have microwave ovens, <em>snack</em> and drink vending machines, tables, chairs and toilets. Students can go there to heat and eat a meal brought from home, or simply take a break between one lesson and the next. These places are also used for linguistic tandem meetings.</p>

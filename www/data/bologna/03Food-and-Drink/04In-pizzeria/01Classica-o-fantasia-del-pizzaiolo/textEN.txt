<p><strong>Classic or the pizzaiolo's fancy flavour?</strong></p>
<p>Pizza is a classic, traditional - indeed ultra-traditional part of Italian cuisine. For Italians pizza is a symbol of happiness and conviviality. Perhaps it&rsquo;s the colour of the ingredients and its round shape? Certainly, pizza is ideal for dining with friends: it&rsquo;s quick to prepare, tasty and cheap.</p>
<p>In the <a href="http://ricette.giallozafferano.it/Impasto-per-pizza.html"> classic recipe</a> the pizza dough is made with flour, warm water, yeast, a little salt and extra virgin olive oil. At the pizzeria, there is a wide choice on the menu: from classic pizzas to fancy ones created by the &ldquo;pizzaiolo&rdquo;, pizza chef, either white (without tomato) or red (with tomato). Evermore frequently you will find dough made from sourdough, wholewheat flour, organic flour, spelt, gluten-free flour, for people with food intolerances.</p>
<p>The queen of all pizzas is the Margherita, with tomato, mozzarella and basil. Like the Margherita is the Bufala, with buffalo mozzarella, which has a stronger flavour. Or the &lsquo;Capricciosa&rsquo;, with mushrooms, artichokes, black olives and cooked ham. The &lsquo;Marinara&rsquo; is very simple, a red pizza with tomato, oil, garlic and oregano. There is an infinite list of classic pizzas. Just think if we add the pizzas invented by the pizzaiolo. In any event, the best pizza is cooked in a wood-fired oven, at a very high temperature.</p>

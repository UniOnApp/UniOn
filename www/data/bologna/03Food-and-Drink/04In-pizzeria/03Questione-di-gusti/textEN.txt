<p><strong>A question of tastes?</strong></p>
<p>Some like their pizza thick and soft, and others prefer it thin and crispy. A question of tastes but also of culinary tradition. The Neapolitan &ldquo;verace&rdquo; pizza is round, with a soft dough and high sides. The pizza in Rome is very thin and crispy and the dough is often rolled out with a rolling pin. And then there is the pizza siciliana, genovese and marchigiana. One variant of pizza is the calzone, a closed pizza folded over with the ingredients (tomato, mozzarella, etc.) inside. Since 4 February 2010 the pizza napoletana has been officially recognised as a &ldquo;Guaranteed traditional speciality&rdquo; by the European Community.</p>
<p>Italians usually accompany their pizza with a cold beer, a small one, a <em>media</em> (40 cl) or a large, depending on how thirsty they are and how they cope with alcohol. Some however prefer a coca cola or other soft drink, but certainly not wine. Wine doesn&rsquo;t go well with pizza.</p>
<p>One important thing: Italians have no scruples when it comes to ordering a pizza to suit their tastes. You may kindly ask the waiter to add an ingredient you like or take off one you don't. In Italy pizza is almost always eaten as a single dish followed, if you like, by a dessert or a sorbetto.</p>
<p>If you are in a hurry and don't have time to sit at the table, you could go for a pizza al taglio, a slice of pizza to eat on the move. If you prefer eating your pizza at home, you can order one to take away.</p>

<p><strong>Tell me what pizza you eat and I&rsquo;ll tell you where you come from</strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;When the Mayor of New York, Bill de Blasio, ran his electoral campaign, he almost slipped up on the &ldquo;pizza scandal&rdquo;. The <em>tabloids</em> did not forgive him for eating his pizza with a knife and fork. Pure, elite snobism! De Blasio, who returns to Italy often &ndash; &lsquo;spesso e volentieri&rsquo;, politely defended himself: Italians often eat their pizza with cutlery, not with their hands. He shouldn&rsquo;t have said that! What do Italians have to do with pizza? Everyone knows that pizza is a typical New York dish. How could de Blasio not know about the gastronomic traditions of the Big Apple?&rdquo; (<a href="http://www.repubblica.it/viaggi/2016/07/27/news/new_york_mappa_pizzerie-144917665/?ref=twhr">La Repubblica, 27/07/2016</a>)</p>
<p>But in fact there is a lot of confusion over the origins of pizza. Like all good things, many people want to have invented it.</p>
<p>While some sources date pizza (or something like it) back to Etruscan times, it was certainly described in some 16th century manuscripts as &ldquo;a focaccia accompanying meat and other foods&rdquo;. But the history of pizza as we know it today starts in Naples, firstly white, without tomato, garnished with garlic, lard and sea salt, and, from the 18<sup>th</sup> century, served red, with tomato.</p>
<p>It was a dish for the poor, because &lsquo;focaccia al pomodoro&rsquo;, as it was called, was sold on the streets for a pittance, but also became a delight for the wealthy, when Raffaele Esposito, one of the city&rsquo;s most famous bakers, served it to the noble Savoy family. Legend has it that, in 1889, Margherita, Ferdinand of Savoy&rsquo;s daughter, particularly enjoyed her pizza with mozzarella, tomato and basil, and so this was given her name and became the pizza Margherita.</p>
<p>Aside from these charming anecdotes, half way between reality and fantasy, one thing is sure: pizza is a classic Italian meal, and it&rsquo;s hard to find anyone who doesn't like it. The figures speak for themselves: the pizza market (eaten in, taken out, cut into slices, frozen, etc.) produces an incredible turnover, with almost three billion pizzas eaten every year. In Italy tastes vary from North to South. According to a survey conducted on 4,000 Italians aged between 18 and 65, the favourite pizza in Northern Italy is with &lsquo;ham and mushrooms&rsquo;, followed by the &lsquo;capricciosa&rsquo; and the &lsquo;vegetarian&rsquo; while the favourite one in the South is with mozzarella di bufala, followed by the &lsquo;marinara&rsquo; and &lsquo;tuna and onions&rsquo;. </p>

<p><strong>Pulcinella's invention</strong></p>
<p><em>Ladies and gentlemen, please come forward, the more the merrier!</em><em><br /> </em><em>Come and see the great invention, this formidable invention. </em><em><br /> </em><em>I didn&rsquo;t come to market to sell smoked smoke!</em></p>
<p><em>I didn&rsquo;t come to the fair to sell the holes in gruyere cheese.</em><em><br /> </em><em>My name is Pulcinella and I invented the moz - za - rel - la!<br /> </em><em><br /> </em><em>Round these parts, ladies and gentlemen, I am Pulcinella, the great inventor!</em><em><br /> </em><em>To console the poor, I invented spaghetti.</em><em><br /> </em><em>To bring happiness to everyone&rsquo;s life, I created the pizza Margherita!</em><em><br /> </em><em>Oil, flour, tomato, nothing is more worthy of this treasure.</em><em><br /> </em><em>People flock to listen, then have fun... and they buy nothing!!</em></p>

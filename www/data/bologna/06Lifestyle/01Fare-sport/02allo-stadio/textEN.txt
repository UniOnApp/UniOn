<p><strong>At the Stadium</strong></p>
<p>Bologna Stadium is one of the city&rsquo;s major sports facilities and lies just outside the city walls, 6 km from the centre, in the Saragozza district. Seating around 40,000, 10,000 in the grandstand, it has a grass football pitch, an athletics track with 8 lanes and an Olympic swimming pool. The sports here include football, athletics, martial arts, gymnastics and swimming. In 1983 the Stadium was dedicated to Renato Dall&rsquo;Ara, chairman of the Bologna football team (Il Bologna) for thirty years, from 1934 to 1964. Dall&rsquo;Ara died in 1983, on the eve of the winning of the team&rsquo;s seventh championship, after a final against Inter, a team from Milan. Its first name was &lsquo;il Littoriale&rsquo;, the first Italian stadium built with public funds, and one of the largest and most modern of the time. The inauguration on 29 May 1927 was attended by Vittorio Emanuele III and Benito Mussolini who, it is told, entered the stadium on his white horse. Opposite the grandstand you will find the Marathon Tower, which housed the statue of the Winged Victory and the equestrian statue of Mussolini. After the fall of Fascism, the stadium changed its name to &lsquo;il Comunale&rsquo;, until 1983, when it was changed again to the Dall&rsquo;Ara Stadium.<br /> The walls are made from typical Bolognese red brick, with arched windows and a link to the portico leading to the Basilica of San Luca. During the restructuring of the stadiums for the World Cup in 1990, held in Italy, the capacity of the Dall&rsquo;Ara was increased, new security exits and a new electronic scoreboard were installed. <br /> Bologna football club was founded in 1909 and has a red and blue strip. The team is in &ldquo;serie A&rdquo;, the top league, and according to official rankings is the eighth best Italian team. The team mascot is Doctor <a href="http://www.bolognawelcome.com/home/scopri/luoghi/cultura-e-storia/passato-presente/dottor-balanzone/">Balanzone</a>, an ancient stock character of Venetian comedy, who represents the city in a comic and burlesque manner.<br /> The stadium frequently hosts concerts, attracting up to 55,000 people, distributed among the <em>parterre</em> , the steps and the numbered stands.</p>

<p><strong>Basketball champions</strong></p>
<p>The Bolognese people are huge fans of basketball (pallacanestro in Italian). The city has two very strong and famous teams, Virtus and Fortitudo, who have always been bitter rivals. The Palazzetto dello sport was built in 1956 based on a design by architect Francesco Allegra and, after a number of restructuring works, today seats 5,570. In 1996 the palazzetto was named after Giuseppe Dozza, the Mayor of Bologna who pushed for it to be built, and thus its name Paladozza. It was inaugurated on 12 September 1956 during an international match between Italy and Poland, which Italy won with a final score of 70-54. It hosted the matches of both of the city&rsquo;s main teams, <a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtus_Pallacanestro_Bologna">Virtus</a> and <a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortitudo_Pallacanestro_Bologna">Fortitudo</a>, until the late 90s, when firstly one and then the other moved to the PalaMalaguti (today Unipol Arena) in Casalecchio di Reno. In 1999 the white-and-blues, Fortitudo, obtained the twenty-year management of the place, and since the 2005/2006 season has been sponsored by <a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Land_Rover">Land Rover</a> so it is also known as the Land Rover Arena. The Paladozza was last restructured in 2000: above the pitch you will see Europe&rsquo;s largest and most futuristic maxi screen. The Paladozza also hosts music, theatre and dance events.</p>

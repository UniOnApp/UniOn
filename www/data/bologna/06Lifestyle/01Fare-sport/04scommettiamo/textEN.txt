<p><strong>Let&rsquo;s place a bet on it!</strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;80 years ago saw the d&eacute;but of Arcoveggio, but the passion for horses in Bologna has an even older history&hellip;&nbsp;<br /> "<em>O cavallina, cavallina storna&hellip;</em>". This is a famous verse of one of the most loved poems by Giovanni Pascoli (1855- 1912), born in San Mauro in Romagna, but Bolognese by adoption. Pascoli studied at Bologna University thanks to an allowance (today we would say study grant) and became a favourite student of Carducci, and fell in love with our city: just think of his "Canzoni di Re Enzo". Returning to his "cavalla storna", the dappled-grey horse, &ldquo;born among the pine trees on the salty beach&rdquo;, perhaps not everyone knows that the dappled-grey horse was a <em>ante-litteram</em> trotter, hooked up to a gig&rdquo;.<br /> The race track area covers 169,000 sq.m.&nbsp;The stands and parterre hold a total of 12,000 spectators, with 1,300 covered seats, 380 of which are heated. The digital maxi-screen is 35 sq.m. and 290 monitors are installed in key points around the stadium. The race track is 800 metres long with a maximum width along the straight of 23 metres and a minimum width on the bend between the home straight and the opposite side of 22.07 metres. The terrace was extended by 43% in 2004 with 84 sq.m. of new terraces, now measuring 278 sq.m.&nbsp;The car park has 574 places, covering an area of 19,350 sq.m.<br /> At the race track you can bet in three different ways: parimutuel, in <em>simulcasting</em> areas and at the terminals. For parimutuel betting simply go to one of the desks at the track. Your bet, along with all the others, goes into the jackpot. After the race, the national tote divides the jackpot and calculates the stakes for the winners. You can bet in advance, even at the start of the race meeting, on all the races for that day. Before you bet, check all the information on the races: the horses&rsquo; performance, the jockeys and the forecasts. Keep an eye on the monitors connected directly to the tote: for each horse they show the probable stakes for a win, place, each way and treble. The higher the stakes the less chance of a win, and vice versa.</p>
<p>The minimum tote bet is 2 Euros. The cost of the systems depends on the number of horses you bet on. You can find out all you need to know at the desks.</p>

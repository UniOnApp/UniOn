<p><strong>Baseball at Gianni Falchi</strong></p>
<p>Gianni Falchi is a baseball pitch in Piazzale Atleti Azzurri d&rsquo;Italia, in the outskirts of Bologna near the Ponticella district. The pitch was inaugurated in 1969 during a friendly match against the team from Milan, and hosts the team <a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortitudo_Baseball_Bologna">Fortitudo Baseball Bologna</a>, founded in 1953 and today the holder of ten titles (<em>scudetti</em>). Some of the world baseball championship matches were held here (in 1978, 1988, 1998, 2009), as well as some European championships and two editions of the Intercontinental Cup. <br /> Gianni Falchi, a journalist, was one of the first people in Italy to talk about this sport. The excellent architectural structure and the stands in blocks offer spectators a perfect view of the pitch. The pitch is in grass and red dirt, and measures 100x120 metres. The grandstand seats 600 and the open stands 5,000. Although it remains a niche sport in Italy, above all compared to football and basketball, baseball is becoming increasingly popular among young people.</p>

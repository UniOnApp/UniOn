<p><strong>Jogging among the stalls</strong></p>
<p>A stone&rsquo;s throw from the railway station you will find the main entrance to the Parco della Montagnola, one of the city&rsquo;s oldest parks, along the monumental staircase, the <em>Pincio di Bologna,</em> built in 1896 by Tito Azzolini and Attilio Muggia. At the top you will find a panoramic terrace offering a lovely view of Bologna. Just below, you will see the Bus Station. The staircase has 72 candelabras in cast iron with six or four street lamps. The main front is decorated with two bas-reliefs: "Bologna docet" by Arturo Colombarini and "Bologna Libertas" by Ettore Sabbioni. The fountain in the centre of the Park, a large circular tank with water shoots, represents a nymph attacked by an octopus and was built for the Emila Expo in 1888 by Diego Sarti and Pietro Veronesi. <br /> The second entrance to the park is on Via Irnerio, opposite Piazza VIII Agosto. The whole garden is surrounded by a broad tree-lined avenue with benches and tables for picnicking outdoors. Covering a total of 6 hectares, with an architectural layout dating back to the Napoleonic era, there are some centuries-old plane trees, as well as lindens and horse chestnuts. The park has a few bars, an ice cream shack and several recreational areas. The park comes alive above all on summer evenings, with open-air cinema events and dance performances. Every Friday and Saturday throughout the year the famous market is held, running from Piazza VIII Agosto to the Montagnola area. Here the stalls sell mostly ethnic crafts, <em>vintage</em> items and second-hand clothing. The Municipality has made great efforts to enhance this area of the city centre, but some areas are still quite degraded; this is why you should pay attention above all when walking here in the evening.</p>

<p><strong>A park or a wood?</strong></p>
<p>This huge, beautiful green space between Bologna and Casalecchio, not far from the Basilica of San Luca, has two names, with very clear origins: Parco Talon and Parco della Chiusa. Talon derives from the surname of the Marquis Sampieri Talon, owners of the land and woods where the park stands today, on which they built their villas, surrounded by French, Italian and English-style gardens. Still today the wood stretches behind the villas, on the adjacent hills; once a hunting reserve and source of firewood for the noble families of the time, today it is a huge publicly owned green area. Inside there are five farm estates, the municipal greenhouse for biodiversity, hosted in Villa Sampieri Talon, the Casa per l&rsquo;Ambiente, managed by volunteer associations and the starting point for guided tours of the park. There is also a small lake with statues and kiosks. The park is now owned by the Municipality and was opened to the public for the first time in 1975.</p>
<p>The second name of the Park derives from the name of Europe's oldest hydraulic works that has been in operation continuously until today, La Chiusa (the Lock), a Roman aqueduct dating back to 100 B.C. This aqueduct carries water from the River Setta, captured around ten kilometres upstream, to the centre of Bologna. In 1208 the Lock began to provide power to the mills and factories of the medieval city at the expense of the municipality of Bologna. The Great Lock, as we see it today, was built in 1508 at the wish of Pope Pius V, this great hydraulic engineering work was designed by Vignola. &ldquo;Symbol of the water which united rather than divided the people of Bologna in a culture of industriousness and peace, on 28 December 2010 the Lock was included in the UNESCO 2000-2010 heritage messengers programme as a symbol of the culture of peace in favour of young people, with the following reason: &ldquo;Water is a source of life, its conservation and sharing with neighbours a source of peace&rdquo;. <br /> Every year on May 1<sup>st</sup> the famous Kite Festival is held, one of the many events organised in the Park in the spring.</p>

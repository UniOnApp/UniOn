<p><strong>Observing plants and flowers</strong></p>
<p>The Botanical Gardens of the University of Bologna date back to 1568, designed by Ulisse Aldrovandi and one of the oldest in Italy. Having changed locations several times, in 1803 it was located in Via Irnerio 42, in the heart of the university area, where it still stands today, covering a rectangular area of around 2 hectares (1 hectare = 10,000 square metres).<br /> The gardens are home to over 1,200 varieties of plant, organised according to two main display criteria: the collection of exotic plants and particular medicinal plants, as was done originally by the founders of the Botanical Gardens, with the reconstruction of natural environments (for example the wood of deciduous trees latifoglie of the Apennines), in which the plant species are associated in a similar manner to how they are in nature. All the plants have an identification plate listing the species, family and geographical distribution. In the first case, the &ldquo;Orto dei Semplici&rdquo; (<em>Hortus simplicium</em>) is a place for growing and studying medicinal plants, as was done in the Middle Ages. &ldquo;Simple&rdquo; refers to the curative principles obtained from nature from herbs, while &ldquo;Composite&rdquo; referred to drugs obtained by mixing and processing different substances. The Officina, from which the name officinal plant comes, was the laboratory in which the plants were dried, ground, processed in different ways, thus creating drugs. The Botanical Gardens also have four greenhouses, two tropical (<a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bromeliaceae"><em>Bromeliaceae</em></a> and <a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orchidee">orchids</a>, coffee, <a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arecaceae">palm trees</a>, <a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spezie">spices</a> and <a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piante_medicinali">medicinal plants</a>, as well as plants of economic interest) and two with succulents (around 5,000 cacti from Central and South America, Africa, Madagascar and the Canaries). A small greenhouse hosts a collection of insect-eating plants. In addition to promoting learning activities for the Schools, the Botanical Gardens also supports research and takes part in many national and international university projects. The Botanical Gardens are part of the Alma Mater Studiorum University of Bologna Museum System - <a href="http://www.sma.unibo.it/">SMA</a>.

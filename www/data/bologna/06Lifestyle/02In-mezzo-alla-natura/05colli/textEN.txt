<p><strong>On the hills</strong></p>
<p>The road to Parco Cavaioni winds upwards through the Bologna hills, it is very windy but also very panoramic and a pleasure to drive along. Parco Cavaioni is a haven for the Bolognese people seeking refuge from the heat during the summer, they escape from the centre and climb the hill in search of cool air, and the more romantic seeking shooting stars on the night of St. Lawrence. The distance from the city reduces the brightness of this area making it easier to see the night sky. Many summer parties are held in Parco Cavaioni. There are barbeques for cooking meat and many groups of young people often come here to spend their evenings. With 38 hectares of land, the Park is not fenced off and has a bar and a horse riding centre. The meadows are surrounded by mixed woodlands with Turkey oak, ash, European hornbeam, wild pears and shrubs. There are three types of oak: the Turkey oak, which generally lives at higher altitudes (around 600 m), but has settled well here too, the pubescent oak, typical of the hills and finally the holly oak, an evergreen oak that is typical to Mediterranean areas. Among the shrubs you will find heather, juniper, dog rose and hawthorn. An attractive path through the woods leads to a small lake.</p>

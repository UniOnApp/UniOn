<p><strong>The Margherita Gardens</strong></p>
<p>Measuring 26 hectares (1 hectare =10,000 square metres), the Giardini Margherita is the park closest to the city centre. Just outside the walls, the two main entrances are next to Porta Castiglione and Porta Santo Stefano. This park is known for its beauty and its liveliness, and the wide variety of trees and plants. We might recognise, for example the linden, oak, yew, cedar, plane, pine, horse chestnut and magnolia, a sequoia, in the midst of far-reaching meadows surrounded by tree-lined avenues. In the centre there is a small lake with goldfish, carp, water turtles and lilies, run over by a small brick bridge leading from one side of the park to the other. The lake is surrounded by false plaster rocks, imitating romantic English gardens. The park, designed by Count <a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ernesto_Balbo_Bertone_di_Sambuy">Ernesto Balbo Bertone di Sambuy</a>, was inaugurated during a sumptuous event on 6 July 1879, five years after the start of the works and a year after the visit to Bologna by Queen Margherita, whom the park is named after. During the works archaeologists brought to light the remains of a large Etruscan necropolis and many archaeological findings which are kept today in the Civic Archaeological Museum in Bologna. Opposite the entrance at Porta Santo Stefano stands the equestrian monument to Vittorio Emanuele II, created by sculptor Giulio Monteverde in 1884.<br /> In the spring and summer the park is packed with people doing all sorts of sports, frisbee, basketball, volleyball, jogging, etc., or relaxing in the shade with a book or having a picnic and playing music. The tree-lined avenues are filled with <em>roller-bladers</em> and cyclists <em>a passeggio</em>. In the park you will also find a chalet, a famous place for summer evenings in Bologna, an ice cream shack and a fun park for children, with trampolines. Again in the summer, along the garden&rsquo;s ancient greenhouses, another very popular place in the summer, &ldquo;Le Serre&rdquo;, is packed in the evenings. Finally, among the many events organised, every year in May there is an important flower <em>festival</em>, attracting people from beyond the city and outside the region.</p>

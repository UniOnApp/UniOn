<p><strong>In hospital</strong></p>
<p>There are four large public hospitals in Bologna, in different parts of the city: the <a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Policlinico_Sant'Orsola-Malpighi">Policlinico Sant'Orsola-Malpighi</a>, the <a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Istituto_ortopedico_Rizzoli">Rizzoli Orthopaedic Institute</a>, the Ospedale Maggiore and the Ospedale Bellaria. </p>
<p>The Sant&rsquo;Orsola-Malpighi, near the city centre, is a university hospital and also home to the School of Medicine and Surgery of the University. It is a national centre of excellence. With its 68,000 admissions every year, of which 10.5% are resident outside the province and 15.4% outside the region (2016 data), the Sant&rsquo;Orsola was awarded the <a href="http://www.bolognatoday.it/cronaca/sant-orsola-migliori-ospedali-italia-bologna.html">2016 prize</a> &ldquo;<a href="http://www.bolognatoday.it/cronaca/sant-orsola-migliori-ospedali-italia-bologna.html">Amministrazione, cittadini, imprese</a>&rdquo; as Italy&rsquo;s best hospital, for the &ldquo;efficient use of resources, clinical efficacy and relations with patients&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The main premises of the Rizzoli Orthopaedic Institute, a centre of excellence for orthopaedics and traumatology, is located in the hills above the city, just outside Porta San Mamolo. The Maggiore Hospital on the other hand lies to the west of the city on via Emilia Ponente, around 1.5 kilometres from Porta San Felice. The three main buildings have a total of 15 storeys, connected to other smaller facilities, including the Maternity department and the Infectious Diseases ward. The Hospital also has a heliport for serious emergencies. In 1994, after the Formula 1 accident during the San Marino Grand Prix, Ayrton Senna was transported from Imola to the Maggiore Hospital heliport. </p>
<p>Finally, Bellaria Hospital is located in a green area in the hills between the municipality of Bologna and <a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Lazzaro_di_Savena">San Lazzaro di Savena</a>. Founded in 1927, Bellaria Hospital has a Blood-Sample Centre with direct access: if you have to have blood tests, you don't need a CUP appointment, just the prescription from your GP. Among its key specialisations, neurosurgery with a neuroradiology&nbsp;warn focusing on neurosciences. </p>

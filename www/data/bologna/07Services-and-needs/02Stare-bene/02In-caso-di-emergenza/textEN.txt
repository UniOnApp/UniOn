<p><strong>In an Emergency!</strong></p>
<p>In an emergency you can contact the Accident and Emergency department - Pronto Soccorso (PS) generale at the Sant&rsquo;Orsola (via Albertoni, 15) or Maggiore hospitals (Largo Nigrisoli, 2). You may go to the Pronto Soccorso if you are advised to do so by your GP or the <em>guardia medica</em>, or for any other emergencies or illnesses which must be treated immediately, or which are particularly worrying. At Sant&rsquo;Orsola there are also emergency specialists in ophthalmology, gynaecology, paediatrics and orthopaedics. At Maggiore Hospital there are PS services for Obstetrics, Gynaecology and Orthopaedics. At the A&amp;E you will be assigned a code according to the urgency and severity of your health condition. The white code means there is no urgency and indicates treatments which could be given by your GP. If you are assigned a white code you must pay a ticket. The green code is assigned for minor urgencies, such as a trauma, fracture, injury, but without any particular risk or hazard. The yellow code indicates a non-life-threatening condition but with some compromised circulatory or respiratory functions. This is therefore a real emergency which must be treated quickly. The red code indicates an immediate life-threatening hazard (shock, loss of consciousness, cardiac arrest, etc.). For white and green codes you will usually have to wait a long time, perhaps even hours. If you need to call an ambulance, in an emergency, dial 118, which is operative 24/7, and describe your symptoms and the situation, either your own or that of the sick person you are assisting. If you don't speak Italian well, ask to speak to an operator who speaks English. Only contact 118 in the event of a real emergency.</p>

<p><strong>At the doctors</strong></p>
<p>If you don't feel well, if you need medical care or medicines, you can contact a general practitioner or family doctor. To choose the doctor who suits you, consult the &lsquo;Salute Bologna&rsquo; portal, <a href="https://www.progetto-sole.it/cercamedico/">Cerca Medico</a>. On the website you will also find an interactive map in which the surgeries of the doctors are shown according to your area of residence. If you have not been recommended an MMG, i.e. &lsquo;medico di medicina generale&rsquo; or GP, you can find one according to which part of Bologna is most convenient for you. Once you have identified the GPs in your area, check the surgery times and see what the availability is. Each GP can only see a certain number of patients every year.</p>
<p>Sometimes, your GP may think you need a specialist visit, a consultation with a doctor specialised in certain diseases, such as a dermatologist (for skin problems), a gastroenterologist (the digestive system), an orthopaedic specialist (joints and bones), an allergologist (experts in allergies and intolerances) and so on. In this case you will be given a prescription also known as &lsquo;ricetta&rsquo; or &lsquo;impegnativa&rsquo;, you must use to book your appointment via a CUP office &ndash; Centro Unico di Prenotazione (Central Booking system). The list of CUP offices can be found on the website Salute.Bologna. Almost all pharmacies also have a CUP booking service. For specialist visits in public facilities or privately-owned facilities providing public services, you have to pay a fee called a &lsquo;ticket&rsquo; which covers part of the costs incurred by the national health system. The cost of a private specialist appointment is high, usually between 100 and 200 EUR. <br /> The &ldquo;impegnativa&rdquo; or &ldquo;ricetta&rdquo; is also required for the prescription of medicines, with the exception of &ldquo;over-the-counter medicines (&lsquo;da banco&rsquo;), basic drugs for self-medication which are not risky (such as pain killers, cough syrup, antipyretics etc.).</p>
<p>If you are an EU citizen, do not forget to bring your European health card (European Health Insurance Card &ndash; EHIC/ &ldquo;TEAM card&rdquo;). If you are a non-EU citizen and have private insurance, you must pay for your appointment even at your GP; the doctor will give you an invoice you can send to the insurance company for a refund. Before you leave, check the characteristics and cover of your medical insurance policy.</p>
<p>For emergencies you can also contact the Guardia Medica, which is open from 8 pm to 8 am on weekdays and from 10 am on Saturday (or the day before a public holiday) until 8 am on Monday or the next working day.</p>

<p><strong>At the pharmacy</strong></p>
<p>Today pharmacies are very eclectic places. While before pharmacies sold only medicines or little more, it&rsquo;s no longer like that today, at least in most cases. We can go to the pharmacy for some basic tests such as to check the cholesterol and glycemic levels in the blood, to measure blood pressure or to analyse hair structure. We can book specialist appointments or analyses via the CUP services (Central Booking Service). Or buy phytotherapy products or homeopathic products. We can buy some types of glasses or contact lenses, make-up and perfumes, or even health shoes. If all these characteristics make the pharmacy a hybrid vendor of herbal remedies (you may also come across a para-pharmacy), perfumes, medical services, booking services, health items, etc., the primary vocation of the pharmacy remains that of selling drugs. The pharmacist is an expert advisor you can give you advice on the best &ldquo;over the counter&rdquo; drugs for your needs, or who can provide you with the drugs prescribed by your doctor. Drugs can be administered in tablets, pills, capsules, or in syrup, solutions to be drunk or injected with a syringe. It is important to be able to understand the package leaflet which accompanies each medicinal product. The package leaflet provides important information: the composition of the drug, in particular the active substance, the dosage, the indications, i.e. which condition the drug treats, administration methods, contra-indications and side effects. The administration methods will tell you if you have to take the drug on a full stomach or between meals. The contra-indications sometimes describe interactions with other drugs, which must not be taken at the same time, or the relations with other conditions which could make the drug harmful. The side effects describe the unwanted consequences of taking the drug, from mild, such as drowsiness, to very high risks. The side effects usually also state the frequency with which these occur.</p>
<p>When you go to the pharmacy you may need to take a ticket when you enter. The ticket dispensers help to manage the queue, just like at the post office. Depending on the service you need, take your ticket, e.g. Counter/Banco, to buy medicines, or CUP to book a specialist appointment. </p>
<p>The Municipal Pharmacy in Piazza Maggiore is open seven days a week, and does not close for lunch. During the weekends and after 7.30 pm you need to go to the duty pharmacy open in your area. The list of duty pharmacies (open on a rotational basis outside of normal opening hours) can be found outside the pharmacy or can be consulted on the Internet.</p>

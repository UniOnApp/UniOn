<p><strong>First steps</strong></p>
<p>Finding accommodation in Bologna may be difficult, above all at the start of the academic year. Many students look for places to rent and Erasmus students often have more difficulty finding a place, but don&rsquo;t lose heart. It is more difficult if you stay in Bologna for only a few months or just one semester, or if there are communication problems between the owners and the tenants . If you arrive in Bologna in September, you should find some temporary accommodation, at least for the first few days.</p>
<p>However, you don't have to find you accommodation on your own. Bologna has a number of support services. You can contact the <a href="http://www.sais.ceur.it">SAIS</a> (Student Accommodation and Information Service) or <a href="http://www.bussolacasa.it/it/i-nostri-servizi.aspx?idC=62035&amp;LN=it-IT">Bussola</a> to seek temporary or long-term accommodation, in the university residences, on the campuses, in colleges or short-stay accommodation, or for free help in signing a rental contract.</p>
<p>First of all you must be clear about what type of accommodation you're looking for. The choice depends on your monthly budget, the length of your stay in Bologna, and whether or not you want to share with others. Certainly rents in Bologna are renowned for being among the highest in Italy. Prices vary a great deal, depending on the area and the type of apartment, but some statistics say that the average is 240 EUR for a shared room and 330 EUR for a single room. If you meet the set criteria, according to merit and economic conditions, you may apply for support to <a href="http://www.er-go.it">ER-GO</a> (Regional Authority for the Right to Higher Education) for paying your rent, for short periods.</p>

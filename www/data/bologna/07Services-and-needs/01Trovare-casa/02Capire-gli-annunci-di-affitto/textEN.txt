<p><strong>Understanding rental advertisements</strong></p>
<p>To understand a rental advertisement and the characteristics of the accommodation offered, you should know a few terms. In the Bussola on-line &lsquo;Cerco e Offro casa&rsquo; service, for example, to look for accommodation, you have to specify some information: the monthly rental amount, i.e. how much you are prepared to pay each month for your accommodation, the district in Bologna, i.e. the area in the centre or suburbs you want to live in, the <em>type of accommodation</em>, for example an apartment or a single (for only one person), a double or a triple (for two or three people), and if you're looking for something with only girls or only boys.</p>
<p>In this regard, there are dozens of websites for finding accommodation on your own; the most popular are <em>subito, bakeca, immobiliare, kijiji</em>, etc., as well as several Facebook pages which put owners in contact with future tenants. The advertisements often have lots of detailed information. Let&rsquo;s have a look at an example: <em>&ldquo;</em><em>Small villa with 5 single rooms, huge terrace, 2 bathrooms and kitchen. Large fully furnished room with two beds for rent. Coop viale s.donato 2 min on foot, 1 min from the bus stop (line 20), 5 min by bike to via Zamboni.&nbsp;Expenses excluded. No freshers.&nbsp;Important: availability for 1 whole year. The house will return to the owners in September 2018. </em></p>
<p>In the first part it describes the whole house, for example if it is a single home (in this case a small villa) or an apartment in a condominium; then it describes the inside of the house (for example how many rooms, how many bathrooms, if there are any terraces or balconies, if there is a garden); the characteristics of the room being advertised (furnished or unfurnished, the number of beds, the size); the area of Bologna and services nearby (in this case a supermarket and the proximity to the city centre). This advertisement ends with some other important information: the monthly rent does not include the cost of bills or utilities (water, gas, electricity, internet, etc.) and is not for freshers, i.e. first year students. It also states that the rent shall not last more than 12 months, and the room must be vacated by September 2018.</p>
<p>In other advertisements the owners often add information on the possibility to keep pets, about smokers (sometimes you will see &lsquo;no fumatori&rsquo;), if there is a space to park the car, or a bike cellar (a cellar where you can easily get your bike in and out), if there is air conditioning. In some advertisements it also states the type of rental contract to be signed.</p>

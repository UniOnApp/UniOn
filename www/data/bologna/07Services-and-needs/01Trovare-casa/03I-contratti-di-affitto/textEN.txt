<p><strong>Rental contracts</strong></p>
<p>How can you find your way and sign a rental contract knowing what you are doing? As mentioned in the &ldquo;First steps&rdquo; you can contact SAIS and Bussola for free advice. However, you should be able to understand the most important clauses of a rental contract before you sign it. A rental contract is a formal agreement between you, the tenant, and the owner of the property.</p>
<p>Do not be tempted to pay the rent cash-in-hand, i.e. without a contract. You would not be protected, any would easily be open to fraud and cheating, and above all it is illegal. To reduce the very common practice of paying rent cash-in-hand, the Municipality of Bologna and the University and the Italian Inland Revenue have begun a special awareness raising campaign, playing on the rhyme of &lsquo;<a href="http://www.unibo.it/it/servizi-e-opportunita/borse-di-studio-e-agevolazioni/alloggi-e-sportello-registrazione-affitti/materiale-informativo-affitti-in-nero-convenienza-zero">Affitti in nero, Convenienza zero&rsquo;</a>. A regular contract is in any case required to obtain your residence permit if you are a non-European student. If you pay your rent in cash, ask for a receipt. If you have difficulty understanding the rental contract (the language is rather technical) do not be afraid to ask for a photocopy, which you can read later with somebody who can help you to understand. Always be respectful of your accommodation, the furniture in the house and generally, look after the things in the accommodation you are renting. </p>
<p>How can you find your way through the different contracts and clauses? What do the following terms mean? withdrawal, oppressive clause, deposit &lsquo;? In the contract you will be required to pay a deposit, a sum of money to guarantee the owner against damage to the property and furniture. You will be asked for a <em>caparra</em>, which is the advance payment of one, two or three months&rsquo; rent. The deposit, which can never be more than three months&rsquo; rent, and the advance rent will be returned to you at the end of the contract. To avoid misunderstandings and problems, check the state of the apartment before you move in, and report any breakages or non-functioning appliances to the owner in advance. Good practice includes drafting a short <em>verbale</em> (descriptive report) on the state of the accommodation when you move in. The deposit may be withheld by the owner if there is any damage to the property, furnishings or equipment. Also check the time for withdrawal from the contract, i.e. how many months&rsquo; notice you must give the owner before terminating your rental contract. &ldquo;<em>Dare la disdetta</em>&rdquo; means notifying the owner, usually by registered letter, that from a certain date onwards you will no longer be occupying the apartment.</p>

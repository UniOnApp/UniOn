<p><strong>At the post office</strong></p>
<p>To send parcels or letters, go to the post office, or use the on-line service on the <a href="http://www.poste.it">Poste Italiane</a> website or download the <a href="https://www.poste.it/applicazione-ufficio-postale.html">APP</a> on your smartphone. If you go to the post office in person, take a ticket when you enter and queue up. Be prepared, pay attention and select the right service, checking your ticket number on the panel, so you don't miss your turn. With the Poste Italiane APP, you can select the post office according to the waiting time and then go to the post office only when it&rsquo;s nearly your turn. <br /> Many services are available at the counter: payments and withdrawals, postal payment slips and F24&rsquo; tax forms (if you have to pay something using a postal slip, to be filled in by you or precompiled), shipments and collections (to collect or send a parcel, letter, etc.), &lsquo;financial consulting&rsquo;, etc.</p>
<p>Sending letters and parcels also requires that you take a reasoned decision, based on the urgency, guarantees of delivery and the cost you are willing to pay. Usually, for very important or valuable letters or parcels, send them by registered post (with advice of receipt) or insured post, which cost slightly more. Parcels must not weigh more than 30 kg. Traditional delivery in Italy takes around 4 days, while the more expensive &ldquo;posta celere" takes just 1 or 2 days, excluding public holidays. The journey of your letter or parcel can be tracked on-line. Just enter the shipment code to find out where it is, if it has reached its destination and if it has been collected by the recipient. <br /> Alongside all these cutting-edge on-line services, you can also find dark red metal letter boxes, on the street around the town. They are often next to tobacconists, newsagents, and always at the entrance to the post offices. There are two flaps, one marked &lsquo;per la citt&agrave;&rsquo;, for letters sent to addresses in the city of Bologna, and the second marked &lsquo;per tutte le altre destinazioni&rsquo;, for letters going anywhere outside of town.</p>
<p>Post offices are very eclectic places. The services available go way beyond the mere sending of letters and parcels. For some time now the post office provides almost all the services which traditionally are performed by a bank, so you can invest money, manage a current account, take out an insurance policy, open a savings account. In larger post offices, you can also purchase typical stationery and bookshop items, including books, calendars, notebooks, pens, DVDs, etc.</p>

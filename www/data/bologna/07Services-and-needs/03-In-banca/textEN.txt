<p><strong>I would like to open a current account</strong></p>
<p>In Bologna city and the province there are over 60 banks. Each bank has a main head office and one or more branches. The Cassa di Risparmio di Bologna for example has 50 branches, UniCredit 58, and so on. With numbers like these, we can really say that we are literally surrounded by banks. It is rare to find a road in Bologna without a bank or an ATM machine, above all in the city centre. Banks have quite limited public opening hours; usually three hours in the morning and two or three in the afternoon, from 2.30 pm onwards. They are closed on Saturday. Not all banks will open a current account for foreigners who do not have residence in Italy. If you need to open a current account, you will certainly be asked for an ID document or passport, and you will have to fill in a &ldquo;mandatory&rdquo; questionnaire to understand propensity to risk, if you decide to invest money in securities, shares, funds, state bonds, etc. The bank makes available to its account holders (persons holding a current account) a cheque book. Payment by cheque in Italy is uncommon below a certain amount. You will have trouble finding an Italian using a cheque to pay for something less than 50 EUR, in contrast to what happens in France, for example, where it is common to pay by cheque for amounts of even just a few Euros. It is very practical to make transactions using Internet Banking or Home Banking, so you can do everything you need to do over the Internet without having to go to the bank in person. Via home banking you can make bank transfers, check your credit operations (such as a salary) and debit operations (such as paying your bills), and you can check the balance on your account. At the ATM machines, you can withdraw cash when you need it or check the &lsquo;<em>lista movimenti&rsquo;</em>, i.e. all the incoming and outgoing transactions over a certain period of time; you can also top up your mobile phone. Currently, ATM machine screens allow you to change the language interface so you shouldn&rsquo;t have difficulty understanding.</p>
<p>Many Italians go to banks to ask for a loan when buying a house. These specific loans are called mortgages. If you take out a mortgage, you undertake to pay back the amount in instalments, by paying an amount to the bank each months, for ten, twenty or thirty years. The bank earns money from the interest paid on the loan.</p>

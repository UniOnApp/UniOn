<p><strong>Super, Hyper or Discount?</strong></p>
<p>Supermarket, hypermarket and shopping centre are all large retail chains. The substantial differences lie in their size and the variety of goods on sale. Supermarkets sell almost exclusively food products and personal hygiene and household goods, and are usually no more than 2,500 sq.m. (square metres) in size. Hypermarkets on the other hand may be up to 10,000 sq.m. When they are more than 10,000 sq.m. they are called <em>megastores</em>. Hypermarkets also sell non-food goods, from electronics to telephony, pharmaceutical goods to clothing. The most common supermarkets in Bologna are Coop, Conad, Pam, Esselunga, Carrefour, to name but a few. </p>
<p>We talk of shopping centre when the same building houses not only a supermarket (or hypermarket) but also lots of other shops, with their own separate identity. For example, some very busy shopping centres in Bologna are Centro Nova (at Villanova di Castenaso), Centro Navile (in the Navile district, next to the ring road entrance), Centro Lame (Lame district), and many others. In Bologna the first shopping centre was opened in 1989 just on the outskirts of town, the Centro Borgo. </p>
<p>Meraville in the San Donato district is a <em>shopping park</em>, a retail area with a consortium of large <em>stores </em>(Decathlon, Leroy Merlin, Mediaworld, Casa, as well as a gym, restaurants, herbalists and others besides). Hypermarkets and shopping centres are usually open seven days a week, including holidays, and are open all day long. They are very busy at the weekends, as people often go just for a walk, without necessarily needing to go shopping. </p>
<p>Then there are <em>Cash and carry</em> stores, self-service markets reserved for retailers or professionals with a VAT code. </p>
<p>To save money, <em>discount stores </em>have a slightly different purchase and resale policy. Some people say that they sell sub-brand goods which are of poorer quality, but this has not been demonstrated. Some people on the other hand say that the prices are lower because of the <em>packaging</em> which is more essential, and the fact that there is practically no advertising. </p>
<p>It is also interesting to shop in the so-called &lsquo;single-brand stores&rsquo;. In the city centre, the most famous is Picard for frozen foods. Tigot&agrave; is a store for household goods and cosmetics. And if you&rsquo;re looking for strictly organic foods, head for Natura S&igrave;, the first totally organic supermarket. In Bologna there are several of these stores.</p>

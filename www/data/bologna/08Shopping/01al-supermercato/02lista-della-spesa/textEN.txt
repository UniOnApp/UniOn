<p><strong>The shopping list</strong></p>
<p>Making a shopping list can help you to not forget anything. To find your way more easily, you could organise your list according to the different departments in the supermarket: &lsquo;Meat and Fish&rsquo;, &lsquo;Sliced Meats and Dairy Products&rsquo; (cheese, yoghurt, milk, cream, etc.), &lsquo;Fruit and Vegetables&rsquo;, &lsquo;Delicatessen&rsquo; (where you can buy ready-cooked foods), &lsquo;Frozen foods&rsquo;, &lsquo;Household cleaning products&rsquo;, etc. In the generic food departments, at the start of the aisles, you will find boards describing the products on display, such as &ldquo;tinned foods&rdquo; (tuna, olives, pickles, etc.) &ldquo;pasta, rice&rdquo;, &ldquo;soft drinks&rdquo;, &ldquo;alcoholic beverages&rdquo;. </p>
<p>In large stores will find other departments selling home and garden items, household appliances, toys and sports equipment. The fruit and vegetable departments work on a self-service basis, where you pick the fruit and vegetables and weigh them, paying according to weight. Remember to put a plastic glove on before picking the produce, and check the number on the label and enter it on the self-service. Recent research on the sale of goods in the supermarket shows that Italians increasingly prefer supermarket brand products (Esselunga, Coop, Conad, Carrefour, Pam, etc.), in terms of both qua and price. And about prices and discounts of different kinds, get a supermarket loyalty card, it&rsquo;s free. With the card you will get discounts on some products and earn points. It depends on the supermarket policy, but usually when you've earned a certain number of points you get a discount on your shopping or may choose a gift. </p>
<p>In larger supermarkets, to avoid queueing at the till you can use a &ldquo;SalvaTempo&rdquo; device. This is an electronic device used to read the bar code. When you pick a product, read the bar code with the Salvatempo and when you have finished, you simply pay at the till. Some tills are self-service (Fai da te), for all amounts of shopping. Go to the right till (for example if you have more than 20 items you will probably have to go to the &ldquo;Spesa grande&rdquo; till), pass your items over the scanner, place them in a plastic bag and then pay for your shopping. </p>
<p>Another useful hint is how to choose a trolley to carry your shopping. For just a few items you may need only a small wheeled basket with a plastic handle. You will find them near the tills or at the entrance to the supermarket. For larger shops, get a trolley from the trolley park outside the supermarket. Put a coin in the slot to free the trolley, you will get it back when you return the trolley afterwards. </p>

<p><strong>Food stores</strong></p>
<p>Ippolito Nievo wrote: &ldquo;In Bologna people eat in a year what they do in Venice in two, in Rome in three, and as much as is needed for five years in Turin and twenty in Genoa&rdquo;. Not by chance cooking in &lsquo;Bologna la Grassa&rsquo; has an international reputation for its delights: fresh pasta (tortellini, tagliatelle, lasagne, meat sauces, passatelli, crescentine, tigelle, friggione, certosino, etc.). The recipes of some typical Bologna dishes are deposited with notarial deed at the Chamber of Commerce in Piazza della Mercanzia. Such a long-standing culinary tradition is not seen only in the number of restaurants and &ldquo;osterie&rdquo; (see Food &amp; Drink), but also in the large number of food shops in the city centre, particularly bakeries selling fresh pasta. Some of these are historical shops, which opened in the early 20<sup>th</sup> century. For example, in via Drapperie you will find one of Italy&rsquo;s oldest bakeries, &lsquo;Paolo Atti e figli&rsquo;, &ldquo;which keeps its liberty decorations from 1907: counter, panelling with shelves, windows, frescoed ceilings, lamps and even the tiled floor&rdquo;. Included in the official list of historical Italian shops, it is the realm of tortellini, tagliatelle and other fresh pastas, the Certosino and other sweets. Among the historical food shops <a href="http://www.bolognawelcome.com/home/vivi/shopping/tipologia-di-acquisto/botteghe-storiche/s/model_Luoghi/lingua_it/categoria_108/page_4/">botteghe storiche</a> in Bologna we should also mention the pastry shop Lagan&agrave;, the bakers Priori, the fish shops del Pavaglione and Pescheria Brunelli, Tamburini, the bakers Dante Zanetti, the fruit and vegetable stalls Davide De Coltelli and De Maria, the butchers Zivieri, and the chocolate and conserves shop Majani.&nbsp;</p>

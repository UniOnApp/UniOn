<p><strong>At the tobacconists</strong></p>
<p>As the name says, the tabaccheria is the shop that sells tobacco, packets of cigarettes but also loose tobacco, papers and filters. Here you can also buy stamps, duty stamps (which today can also be printed virtually) and many other articles, including greetings cards, postcards and stationery. The tobacconist almost always sells sweets and chewing gum, lollipops, chocolates and other sweets. In addition to the articles this store shares with the stationers and bars, one specific service provided is the possibility to pay some bills, including utilities (gas, water, electricity, etc.) and road tax. The name &ldquo;Sali e Tabacchi&rdquo; which can still be seen today on the signs outside the shops derives from the fact that many years ago salt was purchased from the tobacconists. Salt was a state monopoly, like cigarettes, and was therefore controlled by the state. Another historical curiosity was the sale of quinine by the state through the tobacconists, until after the Second World War, seeking to fight the spread of malaria.</p>

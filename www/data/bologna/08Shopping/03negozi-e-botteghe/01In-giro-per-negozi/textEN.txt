<p><strong>Going shopping</strong></p>
<p>In Bologna there are shops for every budget. Via Indipendenza, running from the area near Central Station to Piazza Maggiore, is one of the busiest shopping streets in the city. In Bolognese jargon, walking up and down a shopping street is called &lsquo;fare una vasca&rsquo;, &ldquo;doing lengths (in a pool)&rdquo;. To say that they spent time walking up and down the streets, looking in the windows, young people might say &ldquo;today I did five or six lengths in via Indipendenza&rdquo;. This street is packed with <em>franchising</em> chains, where you can buy clothing, shoes, bags, underwear, etc. at a cheap price. </p>
<p>Around half way up via Indipendenza you&rsquo;ll find Piazza VIII Agosto, where the typical Piazzola Market is held every weekend. Continuing towards Piazza Maggiore, the top of via indipendenza meets via Ugo Bassi, to the right, and via Rizzoli to the left. All these roads are packed with shops, boutiques, and craft workshops. The craft workshops can be found mainly in via San Felice, which continues on from via Ugo Bassi. </p>
<p>Another very famous shopping street is via d&rsquo;Azeglio, one of the most elegant and sophisticated in the city. For haut-couture shopping you might like to try Galleria Cavour, home to boutiques of the most prestigious (and expensive) international brands. It is also well worth wandering around Corte Isolani, which links Piazza Santo Stefano and Strada Maggiore. This covered alley is an ancient medieval courtyard housing designer boutiques, furniture shops and art galleries. In these streets you will also find the workshops of master lute makers, producing lutes, violas, violins, double basses, and where pianos can be restored and tuned. In the characteristic streets of the &lsquo;quadrilatero&rsquo; you will also find some of Bologna&rsquo;s oldest grocers: as the name says, via Pescheria is famous for its fresh fish stalls, via Caprarie is now home to jewellers shops but once upon a time you would find butchers selling goat and mutton, via Clavature was home to the blacksmiths, and finally via Drapperie was home to the draperies, selling fabrics.</p>

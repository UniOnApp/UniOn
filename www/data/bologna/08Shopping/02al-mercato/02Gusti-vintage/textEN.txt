<p><strong>Vintage tastes</strong></p>
<p>Are you into recycling, do you like second-hand and fairtrade shopping, or have a passion for antiques? Whether furniture, lamps, prints, books, records or clothes, in Bologna and the province you can find a range of flea markets every week, some of which are renowned. The largest and most attractive is held every second week-end of the month in Piazza Santo Stefano, in front of the Seven Churches. Around a hundred exhibitors from all over Emilia Romagna set up their stalls selling paintings, lamps, jewellery, silverware, books and records, filling the square to the brim and completely changing its appearance. The market is always packed and attracts many collectors looking for original items. <br /> On Thursday in Piazza VIII Agosto the collectors&rsquo; market (is held, where you can find books, magazines, prints and old postcards for collections. This market has a long-standing tradition in Bologna; it used to be held in via Valdonica, in the Jewish quarter, and was called &lsquo;Cel&ograve; Cel&ograve; Memanca&rsquo; (&ldquo;got, got, not got&rdquo;).</p>
<p>Smaller and a little less well known are the antiques and modern antiques markets held under the porticoes in via Matteotti, and the antiques fair held in December under Arches in Palazzo del Podest&agrave;. <br /> For arts and crafts, don&rsquo;t miss DecoMela Art in via San Giuseppe, a street running off Via Indipendenza. Every stand reflects the artistic creativity of its craftsman. The most common items found at this market are jewellery made from metal and semi-precious stones, leather goods, coloured fabrics and small household ornaments including lampshades and candles.</p>
<p>The largest indoor flea market is probably &ldquo;Cose d&rsquo;altre case&rdquo;: a huge warehouse in the Lame district where you can sell your own things (on a consignment basis) or buy other second-hand goods. The value of the goods is estimated by the operators and is fixed for the first 60 days. From the 61st day, the price drops by up to 50%, and gradually drops to zero. In this case the goods are disposed of or given away to charity. The warehouse covers three floors, selling clothing, shoes, household appliances, home and garden furniture.</p>

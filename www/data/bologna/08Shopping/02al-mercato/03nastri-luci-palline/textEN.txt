<p><strong>Ribbons, lights and baubles</strong></p>
<p>During the Christmas period Bologna is filled with lights and decorations. Piazza Re Enzo hosts a huge Christmas tree, the two Towers are illuminated from top to bottom, as are all the main streets in the city, and the traditional Christmas markets open. The oldest one is the <a href="http://www.fieradisantalucia.it/">Fiera di Santa Lucia</a>, on Strada Maggiore, under the Porticoes at the Church of Santa Maria dei Servi. It usually opens in mid-November and ends on St Stephen&rsquo;s Day, 26 December. It&rsquo;s national reputation probably also comes from its history, which began four centuries ago. Some say that it is Europe&rsquo;s oldest Christmas fair, but the sources are uncertain. At the wooden stands, which blend well into the architectural context, you can buy Christmas tree decorations (baubles, lights, typical Christmas sweets such as nougat, brittle and marzipan fruits and, <em>dulcis in fundo</em>, nativity scenes and statues. Next to the angels and shepherds in Bolognese nativity scenes you will also find two statues which represent the spirit of the city, the &ldquo;sfoglina&rdquo; (a woman rolling out pasta with a rolling pin) and a lawyer. <br /> From late November until 7 January a Christmas Fair is held in via Altabella, an indoor Christmas market which always attracts many tourists. Finally, in recent years a traditional French market has been held in Piazza Minghetti, with wooden huts selling French foods, crafts and other trinkets. Over eighty kinds of French cheeses, where you can taste all kinds of sweets including Breton biscuits and macaroons, baguettes and croissants, and even oysters and champagne. The French market usually ends a few days before Christmas. </p>

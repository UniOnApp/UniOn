<p><strong>Local produce</strong></p>
<p>More and more often, Italians choose organic farming products. Even better if they&rsquo;re zero mileage, i.e. farmed and harvested near where they are sold. This lifestyle reflects the great success of local markets, where you can buy seasonal fruit and vegetables, cheeses and meats, wine, oil and vinegar, honey and jams, and many other typical foods produced by local farmers. Just like in the past, before the supermarkets, when you did the shopping at the local market.</p>
<p>In and around Bologna there are lots of &ldquo;Km 0&rdquo; markets, also known as <em>farmer&rsquo;s market</em>. They are held once a week in the open, and the stalls are run by different producers from the local area. To find out the dates and places where these markets are held, consult the <a href="http://www.campagnamica.it/">Campagna Amica</a> network.</p>
<p>The most famous and busiest farmers&rsquo; markets are &lsquo;mercato delle erbe&rsquo;, &lsquo;mercato di mezzo&rsquo; and &lsquo;mercato ritrovato&rsquo;. The mercato delle erbe is at the end of via Ugo Bassi and is the city centre&rsquo;s largest indoor market. It houses the fruit and vegetable market, but there are also many stalls (<em>bancarelle</em>) selling fish, meat, piadinas, traditional cooked foods, as well as places where you can have an aperitif. Since 2014, it has become very popular both at lunch and dinner thanks to the variety of places to eat. The mercato di mezzo is located in the &lsquo;Quadrilatero&rsquo;, an area of central Bologna with an age-old craft tradition. The &lsquo;Quadrilatero&rsquo; stands between <em>piazza Maggiore</em>, <em>via Rizzoli</em>, <em>piazza della Mercanzia</em>, <em>via Castiglione</em>, <em>via Farini</em>, <em>piazza Galvani</em> and <em>via dell&rsquo;Archiginnasio</em>, and here you will find some of the city&rsquo;s most characteristic food stores.</p>
<p>The <em>mercato ritrovato</em> is a farmers&rsquo; market held on Saturday mornings opposite the Cineteca di Bologna, in Piazzetta Pasolini. The produce and goods on sale at the <em>mercato ritrovato</em> come from no more than 40 km away. This is why they are called &ldquo;Km 0&rdquo;. In addition to the sale of typical produce, the market runs educational workshops, concerts and cooking courses.</p>
<p>A brand new and extraordinary location is the FICO &ndash; Fabbrica Italiana Contadina, the world&rsquo;s largest food park, which opened in Bologna on 15 November 2017.</p>
<p>Covering a total of ten hectares (one hectare is 10,000 square metres), two hectares are occupied by farmed fields and stables for animals; there are 40 different food outlets, 40 factories (producing ham, salamis, fish, dairy produce, rice, etc.) as well as boutiques, markets and teaching facilities. This huge food-processing farm represents the most important crops farmed in Italy and the main animal breeds.</p>

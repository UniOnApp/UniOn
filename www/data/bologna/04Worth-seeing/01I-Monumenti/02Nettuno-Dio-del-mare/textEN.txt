<p><strong>Nettuno, God of the Sea</strong></p>
<p>The Fountain of Neptune was built between 1563 and 1566 in the vestry of San Petronio by Flemish sculptor Jean de Boulogne, aka il Giambologna, based on a design by Palermo architect Tommaso Laureti, aka &lsquo;Il Siciliano&rsquo;, at the will of Pope Pius IV.</p>
<p>It is a Renaissance work in marble and bronze, the symbol of papal power: &ldquo;As Neptune rules the seas, the Pope rules the world&rdquo;. Carlo Giulio Argan had given it the nickname of &lsquo;an ornament for the square&rsquo;. Inspired by the architectural principles of symmetry and verticality, Neptune&rsquo;s gaze is firm and proud, not looking onto the square and the people, his right hand held out against the wind, explicit messages and symbols of papal power. Neptune&rsquo;s sinuous form is surrounded by groups of figures, dolphins, mermaids, coats of arms and cherubs. The four cherubs stand at the foot of the God Neptune, and represent the rivers Ganges, Nile, Amazon and Danube, the rivers of the continents known at that time. The stone fountain was built by Giovanni Andrea Della Porta and Antonio Fasano (from Mantau) and Andrea Riva (from Milan). The materials used are Venetian limestone, red ammonite and bronzetto di Verona, in its palest version. The red and white were supposed to remind of the colour of the free Municipality of Bologna, as well as the Basilica of San Petronio.</p>
<p>There are four Latin inscriptions on the sides of the marble tank, indicating its identity and functions: <em>Fori Ornamento</em> (to decorate the square); <em>Aere Publico</em> (built with public money); <em>Populi Commodo</em> (built for the people); <em>MDLXIIII</em> (1564).</p>
<p>In addition to its symbolic value, in the past the fountain had a practical purpose, and the water was taken home by the local people, helped by the water sellers who stood round the fountain. For some time it was also used by the market vendors in Piazza Maggiore to wash fruit and vegetables on market day, and by the washerwomen&rdquo; of Bologna who washed their linen. Some anecdotes tell of the construction of the statue of Neptune. To find out about these, read the story of the black stone, placed in a specific point of Piazza del Nettuno and better known as the &lsquo;<a href="https://www.gustosamente.it/fontana-del-nettuno-bologna/">stone of shame&rsquo;</a>.</p>

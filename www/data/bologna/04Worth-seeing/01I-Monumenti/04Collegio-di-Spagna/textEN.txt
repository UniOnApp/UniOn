<p><strong>Collegio di Spagna</strong></p>
<p>The Collegio was founded in 1364 by Cardinal Egidio Albornoz to host particularly deserving Spanish students away from home with well &ldquo;controlled&rdquo; family backgrounds. It was built between 1365 and 1367 and funded by bequests. From that time on, the collegio has hosted many students who went on to become famous, including Antonio de Nebrija, Ignazio di Loyola, Pietro d'Arbu&eacute;s, and Miguel de Cervantes, author of Don Chisciotte. In 1530 Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor, stayed at the Collegio for four months, for his coronation as Emperor, which took place in the Basilica of San Petronio. The Collegio could host up to around thirty Spanish Christian students with no heretic, Jewish or Muslim ancestors. The students had to be at least 21 years of age. The rules were very strict: the students had to attend all meals, return to the collegio in the evening and never have female guests. The dress code was black suits, without any precious fabrics. Breach of the rules led to a sanction, from a period of bread and water to expulsion from the institute. Today the <em>Real Colegio de Espa&ntilde;a en Bolonia</em>, the only medieval college with these characteristics, hosts particularly deserving Spanish students enrolled in PhD courses and specialising above all in law.<br /> In architectural terms, the collegio lies between the Gothic and Renaissance periods. It has a central brick facade courtyard with frescoed porticoes leading to the Gothic Church of San Clemente and two floors housing the 18th century library, the rooms, the Emperor&rsquo;s chamber, the archive, the medieval university hall and many more rooms besides. The building has a noteworthy portal dated 1525, the work of Andrea da Formigine.</p>

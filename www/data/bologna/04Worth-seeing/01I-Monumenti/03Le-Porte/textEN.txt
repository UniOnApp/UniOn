<p><strong>The Gates</strong></p>
<p>Until the early 20<sup>th</sup> century, Bologna was surrounded by walls, which ran for over 7 kilometres around the city. The third ring, also known as the <em>cresta </em>or <em>circla</em>, was the most recent and was polygonal in shape. The first design, dating back to 1226, consisted of a simple wooden. Only in 1327 were the walls built from stone, using the rubble masonry technique with two walls of parallel bricks spaced around a metre from each other. This gap between the parallel walls was filled with pebbles, bricks and sand. There were twelve gates along the walls offering access to the city across the drawbridges. Today the gates, particularly ten out of the twelve, bear witness to the urban layout of the medieval city, as the walls were almost completely destroyed in the early 1900s to make way for the current ring roads. The town plan of 1889 ordered the twelve gates to be knocked down as well, but thanks to the opposition of Alfonso Rubbiani and Giosu&egrave; Carducci, at least the gates were saved, with the exception of Porta San Mamolo and Porta Sant&rsquo;Isaia.</p>
<p>Each Gate has its own history and architectural characteristics. For example, <em>Porta Saragozza</em> is famous for the events of the 17<sup>th</sup> century onwards, which gave it the name of &ldquo;Porta sacra&rdquo;, &ldquo;sacred gate&rdquo;, or &ldquo;Porta dei pellegrini&rdquo;, &ldquo;Pilgrims&rsquo; gate", probably deriving from a mythical victory of the Christian army against the Muslims. Moreover, the worshippers passed through here on their way to worship the icon of St. Luke. <em>Porta Santo Stefano, </em>the &ldquo;Gate to Tuscany&rdquo;, saw much of the traffic and trade with the city of Florence, from the 13<sup>th</sup> century, when it was built, onwards. <em>Porta San Vitale</em> on the other hand was the &ldquo;Gate to Ravenna&rdquo;. Built in 1286, it was equipped with a drawbridge in 1354, which was demolished in the late 18<sup>th</sup> century. Massive restoration works were carried out on the ten remaining gates between 2007 and 2009.</p>

<p><strong>La selva turrita</strong></p>
<p>Medieval tradition compared the city of Bologna to a selva turrita, a forest (<em>selva</em>) in which, in place of the trees, there were towers (<em>turrita</em>). In his monograph on the noble towers of Bologna, Count Gozzadini mentioned almost 200 towers in Bologna in the Middle Ages, particularly between the 11<sup>th</sup> and 14<sup>th</sup> centuries. Traces remain of around eighty of them today, even though after centuries of wars, earthquakes, lightning and other events, only twenty are still intact. The towers, along with the porticoes, were and are today the architectural symbol of Bologna around the world. They were built by noble families to state their power and wealth in the region, but were also a defence against their enemies. Sometimes they were simply used as houses, prisons or soldiers&rsquo; quarters. <br /> We must make a distinction between towers and tower-houses: towers were usually isolated from other buildings, and were taller, while tower-houses were a family&rsquo;s main home, such as the Lambertini towers in Piazza Re Enzo, Ramponi in via Rizzoli or Catalani in vicolo dello Spirito. And then you will find the so-called &lsquo;torresotti&rsquo; which stood at the City gates in the second city walls, such as the torresotto di via Castiglione and that in via San Vitale. Only four examples of these still remain in Bologna today.<br /> The towers have a square base, their foundations are at least 5 metres deep, built with huge blocks of selenite. The rest of the building is made from increasingly lighter materials as the tower gets higher. <br /> The most famous towers, known as &ldquo;Le due torri&rdquo;, are the Garisenda and the Asinelli, taken from the name of the families that built them. The view over the city from the Asinelli tower is wonderful. To get to the top, at a height of 97.20 metres, you have to climb a winding staircase inside with 498 steps. The Garisenda on the other hand is much shorter (just 47.5 metres), and leans heavily: this can be seen very clearly when coming from via Zamboni. In the XXXI Canto of Inferno, Dante compared it to the giant Anteus bending before him. The two towers are located in a strategic position at the entrance to the city along the ancient via Emilia. Isolated as they are today, in the centre of Piazza di Porta Ravegnana, they do not appear as central as they would have done in their original position.<br /> There are very many guided tours available to discover the beauty of Bologna&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.bolognawelcome.com/home/scopri/percorsi/cultura/bologna-delle-torri/">other towers</a>. In addition to the Garisenda and the Asinelli, the two most famous and visible are the Azzoguidi and the Prendiparte: the first is tallest, measuring 61 metres, from where it takes its nickname Altabella (tall and beautiful), which is also the name of the street on which it stands. It was built by the Azzoguidi family in the early 13<sup>th</sup> century. The Prendiparte on the other hand dates back to the early 13<sup>th</sup> century, and still has two ancient round arched windows, a pointed arch door in selenite, and a gypsum base. Prendiparte tower is now a location for enchanting aperitifs and dinners on the terrace, and also offers tourist accommodation.</p>

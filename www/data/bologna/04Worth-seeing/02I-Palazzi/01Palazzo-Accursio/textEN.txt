<p><strong>Palazzo d&rsquo;Accursio</strong></p>
<p>Palazzo d&rsquo;Accursio faces onto Piazza Maggiore. This building&rsquo;s wealth is its complexity: it houses eight centuries of city history, its four fa&ccedil;ades, each with its own style, bearing witness to this. The left side of the fa&ccedil;ade on the east side (occupied by Piazza Maggiore and Piazza del Nettuno) dates back to the 14<sup>th</sup> century. This area was purchased by the Municipality of Bologna from jurist d&rsquo;Accursio in 1287 and then restructured, later to become the prestigious headquarters of the city council. Here we find a portico with six pointed arches, supported by heavy stone columns. Above the portico there was once a balcony from where the Bolognese authorities threw suckling pig to the celebrating people during the <a href="http://www.pressreader.com/oldbrowser?redirectUrl=/pressdisplay/viewer.aspx?issue=35272010082100000000001001&amp;page=10&amp;article=104896043">festival of 24 August</a>, St. Bartholomew's day which marked the end of the summer works. Beneath the portico now stands the well-stocked Municipal Pharmacy, open 24 hours a day. The Clock Tower, on the corner between Piazza Maggiore and via IV Novembre, was built in the early 13<sup>th</sup> century and stands 36.20 metres tall. In 1444 the public clock was installed: this huge mechanical clock is still working.</p>
<p>An impressive entrance portal divides the older left wing from the Gothic style right wing. The entrance portal is dominated by the bronze statue of the Bolognese Pope Gregory XIII, who reformed the Julian calendar.</p>
<p>On the right-hand side, next to Piazza del Nettuno, on the first floor we can see eight pointed arch windows built by Fioravanti in 1425 and a large window in the bottom half, built by Alessi in the mid-1500s. The terracotta and polychrome statue of the Madonna and Child is a masterpiece by Jacopo della Quercia dated 1478.</p>
<p>The fa&ccedil;ades of the other three sides highlight the military identity and typical defence style of a fortified castle, protected by walls, crenellations, spurs, and keeps: on the north (via Ugo Bassi) and west (Piazza Roosvelt) sides the fa&ccedil;ades have the austere appearance typical of military architecture. The best conserved wing can be found on the South side, on via IV Novembre. Here we can admire the impressive bastions used for defence and as an architectural support for the building and the tower.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.bolognawelcome.com/files/turisti/scopri/percorsi/itinerari-pdf/palazzo-daccursio/3ante_palazzo-daccursio_ita-low.pdf">interiors</a> of Palazzo d&rsquo;Accursio are also worth a visit, for their rooms, furnishings and the view over the Piazza. There are three internal courtyards: of representation, of arms and the prison. Climbing the 16<sup>th</sup> century staircase attributed to Bramante, you reach Sala Farnese and the Farnese chapel, Sala d&rsquo;Ercole, Sala del Consiglio Comunale, the apartments of the Cardinal Legate, i.e. the Cardinal sent by the Pope as his representative.</p>
<p>On the first floor you will find the famous Sala Rossa, where civil weddings are still celebrated today. On the second floor, Sala Urbana is home to the <a href="http://www.museibologna.it/arteantica/luoghi/53004/offset/0/id/36144">Municipal Art Collections</a> and is entirely covered by trompe l&rsquo;oeil vegetation, which was particularly fashionable between the late 18th and the early 19th centuries. Proceeding towards Piazza del Nettuno, you reach Sala Borsa, home to the Civic Multimedia Library.</p>

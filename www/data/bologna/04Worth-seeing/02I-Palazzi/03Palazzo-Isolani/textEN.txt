<p><strong>Palazzo Isolani</strong></p>
<p>The peculiarity of Palazzo Isolani lies in the fact that it stands next to Palazzo Bolognini Isolani, with its very attractive covered tunnel, Corte Isolani, connecting Piazza Santo Stefano and Strada Maggiore. The building, built between 1451-55 in an architectural stay bearing witness to the passage from Gothic to Tuscan Renaissance became home to the Isolani family in 1671. A family of mainly silk merchants the Isolani family quickly made its presence felt on the Bologna political and economic scene. &ldquo;The family&rsquo;s wealth and land estates grew alongside its influence and thus to the original merchant house in Strada Maggiore (1210), was added first Palazzo Isolani, and then neighbouring Palazzo Bolognini (1842) which formed a single estate between Strada Maggiore and Piazza Santo Stefano which today constitute Palazzo Isolani and Corte Isolani&rdquo;. The portico, with its round arches, is supported by Corinthian capitals. Above the arches we can see a sequence of single-light lancet windows containing the faces of six characters with 18<sup>th</sup> century hair styles. The walls of the halls have an 18<sup>th</sup> century style, covered with frescoes and decorated with damask tapestries, while the rooms, measuring 700 square metres, are furnished with furniture and paintings belonging to the Isolani family. The building has an atmosphere of majestic solemnity which is perfect for public events, gala lunches and ceremonies. Corte Isolani is an ancient medieval courtyard housing <em>designer</em> boutiques, furniture shops and art galleries. You will also find the workshops of master lute makers.</p>

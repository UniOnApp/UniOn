<p><strong>Palazzo Re Enzo</strong></p>
<p>In Piazza Nettuno you will find the staircase to <a href="http://www.palazzoreenzo.com/">Palazzo Re Enzo</a>, also known as &lsquo;palazzo nuovo&rsquo;, to distinguish it from the older <a href="http://www.bolognawelcome.com/home/scopri/luoghi/architettura-e-monumenti/edifici-e-vie-storiche/palazzo-del-podesta/">Palazzo del Podest&agrave;</a>. Built between 1244 and 1246 as the Municipal building, it became the sumptuous prison of Enzo, son of Federico II of Svevia. Enzo was made prisoner in 1249 during the battle of Fossalta and remained there until his death in 1272. Many legends surround the history of Re Enzo's incarceration, from his attempted escape from the building to his love for farmer&rsquo;s daughter Lucia di Viadagola, and whose child established the name of the noble Bolognese family the Bentivoglios. As per his wishes, Re Enzo was buried in the Basilica of San Domenico, where his tomb still stands; in 1731 a stone and his portrait were laid in his memory.</p>
<p>The ground floor of the building was originally an armoury and the store of the Carroccio, the large cart which was the symbol of the Municipality of Bologna. The current appearance of the building is the results of the radical restoration works by Alfonso Rubbiani who, between 1905 and 1913, recovered the building&rsquo;s Gothic design.</p>
<p>The courtyard at Palazzo Re Enzo, on the ground floor, measures 250 sq.m. (square metres) and in the centre stands an ancient well in sandstone.</p>
<p>Climbing the 15<sup>th</sup> century staircase, you reach the Sala del palazzo del podest&agrave;, a huge, beautifully frescoed hall, entering through a solid wood door. The large Salone, measuring 800 sq.m., was firstly the hall of justice and later a public theatre. On the same floor you will find the Sala degli Atti and a magnificent external porticoed Loggia, offering a splendid view over Piazza del Nettuno. On the second floor you will find the Sala Re Enzo, another large hall which can seat up to 100.</p>
<p>Today the building hosts important events, including fairs, exhibitions and conferences, <em>conventions</em> and so on. We may mention, among others, the international event <a href="http://www.palazzoreenzo.com/eventi/robot-08/">RoBOt</a>, dedicated to electronic music and the digital visual arts, which is very popular with young people, held every year in the halls of the building.</p>

<p><strong>Palazzo Malvezzi</strong></p>
<p>Palazzo Malvezzi De&rsquo; Medici, in via Zamboni, is home to the Provincial administration of Bologna. The building was defined the &ldquo;palazzo dal portico buio&rdquo;, &ldquo;the building with the dark portico&rdquo;, because of the characteristic shadows created by the porticoes. It was built by the Malvezzis, an illustrious family present in town from the 12<sup>th</sup> century, supporting the Guelph party and actively participating in the economic and social life of the city. The family began the construction works in 1560. In 1725 the staircase was built by Marquis Giuseppe Malvezzi De&rsquo; Medici while only in the mid-1800s the family enriched the main floor, appointing the works to a stage designer. The external fa&ccedil;ade of the building has no particular features to distinguish it from others. Inside on the other hand the sumptuousness of the rooms underlines the family&rsquo;s wealth. The names of the Halls are inspired mainly from the colour of the tapestries: the pink room, the red room and the green room. In 1800 Senator Giovanni Malvezzi and his wife Augusta Tanari had an innovating spirit and new liberal ideas. They decided to appoint the interior decorations to a stage designer, Francesco Cocchi. In 1931 the building was bought by the provincial administration of Bologna and the interiors were sold off on the antiques market. The building can be visited on request. Every day the rooms are used for the institutional activities of the Province of Bologna.</p>

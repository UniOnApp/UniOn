<p><strong>Palazzo Albergati</strong></p>
<p>The construction of Palazzo Albergati began in 1519 at the will of this important Bolognese family, in a privileged position in the city centre, on top of older residential buildings. The long brick fa&ccedil;ade measuring 54.70 metres took on its final form only a century later. The style is very simple and has no particular <a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ordine_architettonico">architectural order</a>. The windows on the ground floor have no tympanum while those on the first floor have an aedicula in Ionic style. On the ground floor there are two portals: the one on the left is Doric with a &ldquo;Romanesque&rdquo; style while the one on the right has leaner, more sober forms. Inside the Palazzo there are a number of precious frescoes dating back to the 17<sup>th</sup> and 18<sup>th</sup> century, including the ceiling in a ground floor apartment decorated by Francesco Gessi portraying <em>Giove strappa la lingua alla menzogna</em>. Next to this rooms you will find a dressing room with a ceiling completely covered in stucco decorations (festoons, garlands and women's head in Baroque style, etc.) and in the centre a flying cupid painted by Andrea Sirani (1610&ndash;1670). At the main entrance to the building, at via Saragozza 28, a stone on the wall marks the passage of the Tzar of Russia Nicholas I in 1845. The square internal courtyard houses a life-size statue <em>Il cuoco del Faraone</em> by the sculptor Camillo Bersani. Recently the building was renovated following a fire which broke out on 8 August 2008. The restoration works fully recovered all the paintings and Baroque stucco decorating the ceilings of the Palazzo.</p>
<p>Palazzo Albergati currently hosts international exhibitions. Among these, the highly popular exhibitions of Mir&ograve;, Frida Khalo, Escher, Brueghel.</p>

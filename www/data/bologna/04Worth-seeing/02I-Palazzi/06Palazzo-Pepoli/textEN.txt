<p><strong>Palazzo Pepoli</strong></p>
<p>&ldquo;Palazzo Pepoli Vecchio, antique home of one of the most important medieval families of Bologna, is the result of numerous architectural additions and interventions.<br /> Its story began in 1276<strong>,</strong> when Romeo Pepoli bought the first constructions and continued in 1344, when his son Taddeo Pepoli built the first nucleus of the Palace. The Pepoli family, the first to become Lords of Bologna, remained owners of the building until 1910. In modern times, Palazzo Pepoli changed hands frequently, and it even housed a print shop for a certain period of time&rdquo;.<br /> In 2003 the Fondazione Cassa di Risparmio in Bologna bought the building and converted it into the <a href="http://www.bolognawelcome.com/home/scopri/luoghi/cultura-e-storia/musei-e-gallerie-arte/palazzo-pepoli-museo-della-storia-di-bologna/">Museum of the History of Bologna</a>, with restoration and museum lay-out by Mario Bellini and graphic design by Italo Lupi. The Museum &ldquo;tells the whole history of the city and its inhabitants starting from the Etruscans to modern times, presenting (...) key episodes, symbolic figures, anecdotes and transversal themes&rdquo;. &ldquo;In the centre of the covered courtyard corte, architect Bellini placed the Tower of Time, a glass and steel structure flooded with natural light. The Tower &ldquo;reinvents&rdquo; the courtyard and it recalls Bologna of the Towers, making the entire museum itinerary seamless between the ground and the first floor. The destiny of the Palazzi is sometimes like that of men. They risk being forgotten and falling into irreversible decay. Palazzo Pepoli Vecchio, which risked this fate, today returns to shine and show (the great history of Bologna) in a new and surprising way. This museum for the city was set up, like all my display works, respecting (and separating) the container and the content so that they mutually enhance beauty and meaning. At the centre of the Palace a glass and iron tower reinvents the courtyard so that it regains its dignity and function. It seems like a magic lantern flooded with natural light from above gradually descending into pure transparency. It is almost an epiphany that makes you reflect about the passing of time&rdquo; (text by Mario Bellini). The museum speaks to a wide and varied audience: Bologna citizens wishing to rediscover the history and the cultural heritage of their city; tourists of all ages; schoolchildren and young people, university students, foreigners living in Bologna, and so on.</p>

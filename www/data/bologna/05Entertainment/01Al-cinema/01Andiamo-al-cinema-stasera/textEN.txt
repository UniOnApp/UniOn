<p><strong>Shall we go to the cinema this evening?</strong></p>
<p>Italians just love to go to the cinema in their free time. Some prefer small movie theatres perhaps in the city centre, and others prefer large multi-screen cinemas with their cutting-edge equipment.</p>
<p>Bologna has over twenty cinemas, including some <em>arthouse</em> cinemas, some multiscreens and some parish cinemas. Usually the first showing starts in the afternoon, with very different times (from 2.30 to 4.00) with the last showing at 9.30 or 10.30 pm. In some cinemas, exceptionally for night owls the last showing may even start at 12.30 a.m.! The expression &lsquo;primo spettacolo&rsquo; (first showing) is also used to indicate the first showing in the evening, which starts at 8.30 or 9.00 pm. While &lsquo;secondo spettacolo&rsquo; (second showing) is normally used for the 10.30 pm showing.</p>
<p>In some cinemas the seats are numbered so you can choose which row and seat you prefer, if available. Also in this case it's a question of tastes...or perhaps views, for example some people like to sit close to the screen, others further away and some even in the very back rows. Certainly the most popular seats are those in the centre of the row, right in front of the screen.</p>
<p>During the weekend the cinemas are much more crowded and you may often have to queue at the ticket office. Increasingly often you can buy your ticket on-line, so you can skip the queue and avoid the risk of not getting a seat.</p>
<p>Ticket prices vary according to the day of the week and any discounts available. The cost of a full-price ticket can be as much as 10 EUR in the multiscreen cinemas, and may drop to 3 EUR during the week. There are many reductions available, discounted tickets, particularly for students, the elderly, handicapped persons and members of some associations. Tickets also cost less for films in seconda visione (second-time-round releases), in most cases shown in the parish cinemas. Always check the reductions available during the week and at the weekend and ask for information from the ticket office.</p>
<p>In some cinemas there is an interval between the first and second part of the film, in others this is forbidden! Originally this was a technical pause to change the film reel.</p>
<p>Today it seems to offend some cinefiles (cinema lovers) or, on the contrary, other people love it, as it gives them the chance to go to the bar, the toilet or have a cigarette.</p>
<p>At the cinema, emotions seem to be amplified: sadness, fear, laughter. A <a href="http://www.corriere.it/salute/neuroscienze/15_dicembre_11/perche-andiamo-cinema-piangere-o-aver-paura-0850ebba-a010-11e5-9e42-3aa7b5e47d96.shtml">curious fact</a>: Canadian research published in the journal <em>Laterality</em> demonstrated that &ldquo;in a cinema it is much easier to be thrilled when sitting to the right&rdquo; of the screen, for neurophysiological reasons.</p>

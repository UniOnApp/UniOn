<p><strong>When&rsquo;s the new Benigni film out?</strong></p>
<p>New films are generally released on a Thursday in the movie theatres in Bologna, so that there is a whole new choice for the <em>weekend</em>. The same film may be shown for a few weeks or just a few days. It depends on the success and the number of spectators<em>.</em></p>
<p>Foreign films reach the Italian film circuit a little later than in other European countries, such as France, Spain and Great Britain. In Italy there is a consolidated, artistic tradition of film dubbing. In Italy dubbing is the rule, while original language films are the exception, both at the cinema and on the TV. Only in some cinemas, once a week, they might show an original language film, with subtitles in Italian or sometimes in the original language. In Bologna for example you can see original language films at the Cinema Lumi&egrave;re, and sometimes at the Chaplin, the Capitol, and the UCI Cinema.</p>
<p>Before choosing a film for the evening, watch the <em>trailers</em> and read the reviews, written by spectators or film critics. Any one evening you will have a wide choice of art films, comedies, dramas, adventure films, horror films, crime films, films in 3D or, why not, an animation film, perhaps by Walt Disney or Miyazaki? In Italy, during the Christmas holidays you can see a so-called <em>cinepanettone</em>, mad Italian comedies with grotesque plots packed with double entendres.</p>
<p>At the cinema, the theatres are silent, dark and filled with people. And when you go to the cinema you also have to comply with some basic rules. Some habits are unbearable: whispering continuously during the film, eating and drinking noisily, having your mobile phone ring or vibrate, placing your bag or jacket on the chair in front of you, or digging your knees into the back of the poor guy in front of you! As well as: arriving after the film has already started, getting people to stand up so you can get to your seat. This is also very annoying. Some cinemas will not even let you in once the film has started!</p>
<p>To see Bologna on the big screen, there are a number of famous Italian films set in or near the city. To mention a few &lsquo;<em>Lavorare con lentezza</em>&rsquo;, released in 2004 and set in Bologna in the 1970s, &lsquo;<em>Il pap&agrave; di Giovanna</em>, from 2008, directed by Pupi Avati, and &lsquo;<em>Jack Frusciante &egrave; uscito dal gruppo</em>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<em>Quo Vadis, baby</em>&rsquo;. In these films you can see the city in different periods, noting the transformations over time.

<p><strong>The cultural heritage of the Cineteca</strong></p>
<p>More than just a cinema, and much more than a cinema museum, the <a href="http://www.cinetecadibologna.it/home">Cineteca di Bologna</a> is an authentic melting pot of Italian cinematographic culture from the past, present and future with a wealth of historical films, audio-visual archives, a <a href="http://www.cinetecadibologna.it/biblioteca">library</a>, a <a href="http://www.cinetecadibologna.it/restaurare">restoration</a> centre and a research and training pole. A very rich selection of original language and Italian films are shown in the two theatres at the <a href="http://www.cinetecadibologna.it/vedere">Cinema Lumi&egrave;re</a>, the Sala Mastroianni, named after the famous Italian actor, and the Sala Scorsese, after the Italian-American director, actor and producer. The first, seating 142, shows Italian and foreign films of the past, as well as contemporary works, usually in their original language with electronic subtitles. The second, seating 175, is specialised in showing new releases of <em>art</em> films, cinema previews and meetings with authors and directors. The art films are shown using cutting-edge technologies.</p>
<p>The Cineteca works to spread cinematic culture and history through its unique archives and with the support of a team of experts. The <a href="http://www.cinetecadibologna.it/archivi/memoriaer/result">archives</a> have over 70,000 films (35mm and 16mm) covering the whole history of the cinema: &ldquo;from silent films to modern times, from great art cinema to the most forgotten genre films, from blockbusters to amateur films&rdquo;. The Archives include the <a href="http://www.cinetecadibologna.it/archivi-non-film/pasolini">Centro Studio Pier Paolo Pasolini</a>, the <a href="http://www.cinetecadibologna.it/archivi-non-film/archivio_chaplin">Chaplin</a> archive, the <a href="http://www.cinetecadibologna.it/archivi/corona">Progetto Corona cinematografica</a>, <a href="http://www.cinetecadibologna.it/archivi/propaganda">Cinema di propaganda</a>, and many others.</p>

<p><strong>Showings outdoors</strong></p>
<p>In the summer the cinema moves outdoors, and showings are put on set against the beautiful background of Piazza Maggiore. Every year, from late June to mid-August, the Cineteca, in collaboration with the Municipality of Bologna, organises the film festival <em>Sotto le Stelle del cinema,</em> showing films outdoors, under the stars, free for everyone. Piazza Maggiore becomes an authentic cultural event, and a place to meet up in the summer: a large screen and loudspeakers are set up, and hundreds of chairs are laid out, even though there are never enough for all the spectators to have a seat. Some bring a stool from home, others sit in a bar in the Piazza, others sit on the ground or on the steps of San Petronio. This is an unforgettable experience in a thrilling setting, a chance to see an original language film that marked the history of the cinema.</p>
<p>Other open-air cinemas can be found to enjoy a good film with friends: the Arena Puccini, the Lumi&egrave;re, the Tivoli. Here the films are usually re-screenings from the autumn and winter season, are in Italian and you have to buy a ticket. But it&rsquo;s a great opportunity for seeing a film you missed during the winter!</p>

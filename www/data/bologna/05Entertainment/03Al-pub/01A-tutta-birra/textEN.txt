<p><strong>Beer o&rsquo;clock</strong></p>
<p>Even to order a beer you need the right words, explains Alessandra in &lsquo;<a href="http://www.scattidigusto.it/2014/05/12/guida-alla-birra/">Birre per principianti. Quello che non dovete mai dire in una birreria</a>&rsquo; (Beer for beginners. What you must never say in a pub). Lager, double malt, red ale, draught, in a bottle, golden!</p>
<p>Talking skilfully about beer, like wine or any other alcohol drink, should never be taken for granted: you need to know a few things and use some specific terms. If you already know the brand or the type of beer you want, you&rsquo;ll be fine. At the pub, ask for the beer you want, whether it&rsquo;s on tap, in a bottle or a can, which is easier to carry.</p>
<p>In Bologna there are pubs where you will literally be spoilt for choice with many types of beer (<em>Irish Pub, Amadeus, Malt and Hopes, Master Beer, Victoria Station</em> and many others besides), and some more specialist pubs with craft beers (<em>Lortica, Ranzani 13, la Tana del luppolo, Birra Cerqua, Green River, Harvest Pub</em>, to name but a few). The basic ingredients are always water, malt, barley, hops and yeast. The different processing and fermentation methods, and the type of yeast, lead to a practically infinite variety of beers on the market.</p>
<p>In jargon, we talk of &ldquo;beer style&rdquo;. The beer style varies according to its appearance (colour, clarity, type of head) and the flavour, which may be sweeter or more bitter. The degree of bitterness depends on the quality and quantity of malt, hops, the type of yeast used and the alcoholic strength. <em>Weiss </em>beer, for example, or <em>blanche</em> in French, is top-fermented beer, pale in colour with a more opaque appearance, with average alcoholic strength and a spicy, acidic flavour. &ldquo;Double malt&rdquo; beers, a creative all-Italian definition that actually has nothing to do with the amount of malt in the beer, are stronger. Darker in colour, these beers have a more than 10.5% degrees Plato and more than 3.5% alcohol. Then there are the <em>Pilsner</em> beers, which are bottom fermented, rather bitter and with a strong aroma of hops. Or <em>Brown ales</em>, of English origin, golden in colour with a sweeter flavour. As we said, the list is infinite, and if you really don&rsquo;t like alcohol why not try an alcohol-free beer. Every beer should be served in the <a href="http://www.ciboebirra.it/il-bicchiere-giusto.html">glass</a> that brings out the best in its aromas and characteristics: tulip shaped, goblets, biconical, pint glasses.</p>
<p>What is sure is that all beers must be served cool. If you're really thirsty and can stand your alcohol well, you might like to order a birra grande (a litre of beer!). The birra media is 40 cl (centrilitres) and a birra piccola is 20 cl.</p>
<p>Beers are often small works of art even to look at, thanks to the fantastic label designs or the shape of the glass bottle, and some people even go as far as collecting them. Perhaps in memory of a good night out.</p>
<p>Are you ready to order a bionda media alla spina? And make sure it&rsquo;s chilled.</p>

<p>What kind of drinker are you? Pints of beer or an alcohol-free fruit cocktail?</p>

<p><strong>Fruit cocktail</strong></p>
<p>As we mentioned in Food&amp;Drink, there are many, subtle differences between osterias, bars, pubs, caf&eacute;s and wine bars. Pubs and wine bars are busy mostly in the evenings, from 6.00 onwards, that is to say aperitif-time. Beer, wine and cocktails are accompanied with <em>stuzzichini</em> (snacks) (olives, crisps, savoury biscuits, diced mortadella), more or less abundant depending on the habits of the place you&rsquo;re in. In some places the evening aperitif is more like a real dinner. After you have ordered something to drink, you can help yourself at the buffet, which has lots of different hot and cold dishes. Places serving sumptuous aperitifs are often crowded. Before helping yourself (usually they use disposable plastic plates) you may have to queue up, then you go back to your table for a chat with friends. In these places there is often background music or, sometimes, live music.</p>
<p>Rather than a glass of wine or a pint of beer, some people prefer a cocktail, alcoholic or non-alcoholic, often with fruit. Also in this case the choice is endless, and can vary from region to region. For example, in Bologna the current trend is the <em>Spritz</em>: a cocktail originally from Veneto, made with prosecco, Aperol (or Campari if you prefer it more alcoholic) and soda water. It is served with ice and a slice of orange. But the <em>Mojito</em>, the <em>Moscow Mule</em>, the <em>Gin Lemon</em>, the <em>Daiquiri</em>, the <em>Negroni</em> and the <em>Pinacolada</em> are also some of the popular cocktails in Italy. For example, the Mojito is made with white rum, lime juice, soda water, cane sugar and mint. The mint is muddled with the cane sugar to release all its aroma and flavour. The bizarre star of the <em>Moscow mule</em> is a vegetable: the cucumber. More and more often barmen serve it with a slice of ginger, just like the original recipe, and in copper glasses. A very thirst-quenching cocktail, the &ldquo;Moscow mule&rdquo; has nothing to do with Russia...it actually comes from New York, but is made from vodka and ginger ale. The Negroni on the other hand is an all-Italian cocktail, invented by Count Camillo Negroni, and that&rsquo;s where the name comes from. The ingredients? Campari, Red Vermouth and Gin. And if the barman asks you &lsquo;liscio o con ghiaccio?&rsquo; (smooth or with ice?), don't be surprised. &lsquo;Liscio&rsquo;, in this context, means without ice.</p>

<p>Open air discos, where you can enjoy a concert and live music during the summer, keep cool, chat with your friends or get on the <em>pista</em> (dance floor) whenever you want. Summer discos are more accessible than winter ones, often they have free entry and the dress code is free and easy. These places attract people even if they are not disco lovers in the strict sense. There are a few of these in Bologna, some in the centre but mostly out of town. Villa Serena, for example, is near the Stadium, in a villa covering three floors surrounded by a park. The evenings are quite informal, and often there are craft markets here. The Chalet dei Giardini Margherita is a kiosk set in the park just a stone&rsquo;s throw from Porta Castiglione. During the day it is open to passers-by but in la bella stagione (during the summer) in the evenings it becomes a crowded place with music and partying. In the centre, Vicolo Bolognetti is both the name of a street and the place. The Quadriportico, also home to the Santo Stefano district, has a rich programme of cultural events starting in June and ending in September, with music, exhibitions and food and drink. Then, the Parco del Cavaticcio (name of the canal the old Bologna port stood on) is a very particular place in the ex Manifattura Tabacchi area, near the Mambo Modern Art Museum. The area was redeveloped over 13 years at a cost of 2.5 million EUR. Now the Parco del Cavaticcio has a very special architectural structure, with water structures and lights, and is used for music festivals and concerts, especially in the summer.</p>

<p><strong>Are you on the list?</strong></p>
<p>To get into a disco the list system is still in use. If you are on the list you will certainly get in, perhaps even jumping the queue, or simply getting a discount on the entry fee. The lists are managed by PRs (<em>Public Relations</em> people). The PRs promote events at the disco, organise the advertising, sell tickets at a lower price than you would pay at the disco and earn something for themselves out of the total. How many are you? When you get to the disco entrance, you must say the name of your list and how many of you there are, for example &lsquo;Lista Papido pi&ugrave; 5&rsquo; or &lsquo;Lista Giulia pi&ugrave; 2&rsquo;. Sometimes the cost of your ticket includes a free drink (<em>consumazione</em>). In some rare cases, there may be <em>free drinks</em>, so you pay to get in and can drink whatever you want. If you want to be more comfortable, you could book at table, but take care as the cost of this is often much higher.</p>
<p>Evenings out at the discotheque, usually called just &lsquo;disco&rsquo; by young people, can be very varied. This depends not only on the place but also the DJ and the evening's events. For more elegant disco events, they won&rsquo;t let you in if you're wearing <em>jeans</em> or sneakers. Sometimes there is &ldquo;free but selected entry&rdquo;. By law they should not be able to stop you getting into a public place just because of what you're wearing but some discos apply a &ldquo;dress code&rdquo;. You don't need to <em>essere in tiro</em>, (&ldquo;be dressed up to the nines&rdquo;) as they say, but you shouldn't be too casual or alternative either, because the safety officers on the door, otherwise known as <em>buttafuori</em>, bouncers, might ask you to <em>farti da parte</em> (stand to one side). Some discos have theme evenings (masked parties, <em>white nights</em>), or perhaps Latin American evenings. Also in this case you have to respect the evening&rsquo;s dress code. Important: at the disco you often have to pay to use the <em>guardaroba</em> (cloakroom), an amount for every item you leave there.</p>
<p>There are different types of discos: large ones with different rooms playing commercial music, such as house, dance pop, synth pop; smaller discos generally offer a more sophisticated selection, such as jazz house. In some discos the music is more extreme, such as hardcore or trance. Alternatively some dance halls are specialised in Latin American dancing, tango, etc. &ldquo;HOUSE&rdquo; is a musical genre belonging to electronic dance music (EDM), born in the Chicago discos in the early 80s with a strong disco music influence. ELECTRO HOUSE, a type of music born from the union of electro and house, a pillar of EDM with house and electro sounds with melodies and leads taken from progressive house. Today it&rsquo;s the most popular sound in clubs and festival along with progressive house. TECHNO was born with house music in the 90s, the main difference between techno and house is the speed, techno is more hypnotic with less harmonious melodies&rdquo;.</p>

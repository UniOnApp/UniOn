<p><strong>Clubbing in Bologna</strong></p>
<p>The Bolognese <em>dance</em> street starts from the Twin Towers. Right here, just a few metres from the towers, a staircase takes you down to the Kinki: 40 years of <em>club culture</em>, and one of Bologna&rsquo;s oldest discos. An underground space with an international reputation: here you will see the most extravagant <em>looks</em> in an authentic laboratory of visual experimentation. You&rsquo;ll find the same atmosphere at Hobby One, a club nearby in the heart of the centre, in one of the city&rsquo;s most lively streets, via Mascarella. Dance evenings are on Friday and Saturday.</p>
<p>Again on foot, you could go to Qu-B&ograve;, another underground place for dancing, and highly popular among young people and university students. The Qu-B&ograve; is located in a building dating back to the 14<sup>th</sup> century, in the prisons of Palazzo Pepoli.</p>
<p>Again in the centre, the Arteria is another very popular place. Another &ldquo;underground&rdquo; club which hosts parties for high school leavers, with a good selection of live music for young audiences, and is very popular among university students. Here you could see some avant-garde <em>rappers</em> and <em>rock bands</em> in a small, informal place that often organises events and festivals. It has a packed programme, from Wednesday to Saturday.</p>
<p>The Millenium offers a very varied programme. Every day of the week is dedicated to a different theme: from Latin American music to rock, to events with student groups.</p>
<p>Just outside the city walls, ten minutes from the station on foot you will find Il Cassero. This club is located in an old salt warehouse, the Salara, in an area of the city known as the Manifattura delle Arti, which hosts other key cultural centres: the Mambo, the Cineteca di Bologna and the Cinema Lumi&egrave;re, the Laboratori DMS. You can dance in a tower, with house music and techno, on a dance floor that looks over a part of the old Reno Canal, which once led into the city from here.</p>
<p>Other popular clubs outside the centre are the Ruvido, the Link, the Matis, the Locomotiv and Zona Roveri.

<p><strong>MAMbo</strong></p>
<p><a href="http://www.mambo-bologna.org">MAMbo</a>, The Museum of Modern Art in Bologna, is home to the Bologna Museums Institution and houses over 5,000 modern and contemporary art works, including around 250 by the famous Bolognese painter Giorgio Morandi. <a href="http://www.mambo-bologna.org/villadellerose/">Villa delle Rose</a>, the <a href="http://www.mambo-bologna.org/museoustica/">Museum for the Memory of Ustica</a>, and <a href="http://www.mambo-bologna.org/museomorandi/">Casa Morandi</a> also belong to the same institution. </p>
<p>MAMbo covers a surface area of 9,500 sq.m. (square metres) on the premises of the old Bread Oven (1915), right in the centre of the Manifattura delle Arti, the cultural district of the Porto area, which is also home to the DMS workshops (in the ex-Tobacco Factory), the Cineteca (in the ex-Slaughterhouse) and the Cassero (in the ex-Salara, the salt store).&nbsp;&ldquo;The presence of the museum in this district strengthens the idea of a museum as a new centre of production, experimentation and cultural innovation&rdquo;.</p>
<p>1945 marked a watershed in the organisation of the Museum&rsquo;s works, divided into Historical Collections (from the late 18<sup>th</sup> century to 1945), accessible only to scholars who made a motivated application, and Contemporary Collections.</p>
<p>A part of the Contemporary Collection, including works from 1945 onwards, is on show to the public on the first floor of the museum, in the spaces dedicated to the permanent exhibition<em>.</em></p>
<p>The visit to the museum is divided into nine Sections, one for each thematic area: Art and ideology, 1977; Art and Action, 1968; New Perspectives, 1968; Arte Povera; Form 1; The Informal; Archangels: The Last Naturalism; <em>Focus on Contemporary Italian Art</em>; New acquisitions. The most famous artists include Renato Guttuso, Giuseppe Penone, Lucio Fontana, etc.</p>
<p>In the <a href="http://www.mambo-bologna.org/collezione/arteideologia/">Art and ideology</a> section for example the museum tells of the civil, political and social commitment of some Italian artists from the early Sixties, in a period in which Bologna was a <em>&ldquo;political and intellectual laboratory&rdquo;. </em>Here, the most famous works include <em>I Funerali di Togliatti </em>by Renato Guttuso, the artist who narrated the film <em>La Rabbia</em> by Pier Paolo Pasolini.</p>
<p>MAMbo constantly hosts very important temporary exhibitions; for example in 2016 it put on the retrospective exhibition dedicated to David Bowie with over 130,000 visitors, beating all records as the most visited exhibition in Italy in 2016.</p>

<p><strong>The National Art Gallery</strong></p>
<p>The National Art Gallery of Bologna opened to the public in 1885, although the first catalogue dates back to 1827. Today it is one of Italy&rsquo;s most important Art Galleries and is renowned abroad too. Before being transferred to its current premises, the Complesso di Sant&rsquo;Ignazio, just a stone's throw from via Zamboni, the Art Gallery was in Palazzo Poggi. The Art Gallery buildings were renovated in 1997, and today the works are on display in 30 different modern exhibition rooms organised by art schools, from the XIII (thirteenth) to the 18<sup>th</sup> century. The Renaissance period is represented by the wonderful paintings by Raffaello, Perugino and Tintoretto while the Baroque period includes the collections by the Carraccis and Guercino, to name but a few of the most famous artists.</p>
<p>On the website you can find the photos of all the artworks in the Art Gallery collections, divided into Rooms, representing the full historical timeline of the artworks in the museum: from the 13<sup>th</sup> century to the Gothic Period (Room 1), the Gothic Period (Room 2), Giotto and the &ldquo;Strangers in Bologna&rdquo; (Room 3), the end of the Gothic Period (Rooms 4 and 5), 14<sup>th</sup> century frescoes (Room 6), the Mezzaratta frescoes (Rooms 7 and 8), the 15<sup>th</sup> century and Humanism (Room 9), and so on up to the 18<sup>th</sup> century (Room 28).</p>
<p>Each work is accompanied by a caption. The caption includes a short description of the painting and some technical information: the author, with data and place of birth and death, the provenance of the work (other museum, house of a noble family, church, sacristy, chapel, market, etc.), the measurements in centimetres (cm), the artistic technique, the year of production. For example, <em>L&rsquo;Arcangelo Gabriele </em>by Annibale Carracci is an oil on canvas, and is described as follows: <em>&ldquo;This painting bears witness to Annibale&rsquo;s experience in Venice in 1586-1587. The depth of the subject and great colour intensity is accompanied here by the poetics of natural everyday life developing towards a more direct knowledge of the Renaissance heritage&rdquo;</em>). Among the most common techniques we also find oil on copper, fresco, tempera on panel, and the works may be found on paper or wood, to mention just a few.</p>
<p>The information on the Art Gallery website is available only in Italian and the art language is packed with interesting technical terms.

<p>The Art Gallery also organises a lot of temporary exhibitions in collaboration with the University, the schools, other museums, Arte Fiera, etc., so consult the on-line portal regularly.

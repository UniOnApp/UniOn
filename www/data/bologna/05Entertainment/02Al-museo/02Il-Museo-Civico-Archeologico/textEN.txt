<p><strong>The Archaeological Civic Museum</strong></p>
<p>The Archaeological Civic Museum is located in the 15<sup>th</sup> century Palazzo Galvani in via dell&rsquo;Archiginnasio, opposite the east side of the Basilica of San Petronio.</p>
<p>Inaugurated in 1881, the museum had inherited the archaeological collections from the university museum and the municipal museum.</p>
<p>The Archaeological Civic Museum collections represent the history of Bologna from Prehistory to the Roman Age. The Etruscan section of the museum, for example, introduces visitors to the characteristics of this ancient civilisation which, in 534 B.C. (before Christ), founded the city of Felsina in the Bolognese territory: pots and bowls in ceramic and bronze, personal items, containers with scenes of military, civil and religious life as well as luxury objects such as a candlestick and an ivory chair from an ancient necropolis, located where the Giardini Margherita stand today.</p>
<p>The Egyptian collection is the third most important in Italy, after those in Turin and Florence, and one of the most important in Europe, with 3500 items displayed in three different sectors; the first includes the findings from the necropolis in Saqq&agrave;ra, the second sector includes Egyptian materials from the origins up to the Roman Age, and finally the third has findings illustrating the characteristics of the Pharaoh society: writings, funerals and magic.</p>
<p>The Museum has two different itineraries: the first, lasting around one and a half hours, allows visitors to follow the history of Bologna from Prehistory to the Roman Age, from the Etruscan period to Celtic domination. The second itinerary on the other hand lasts around two hours and houses collections, including a visit to the gipsoteca (collection of Greek and Roman plaster sculptures) and the lapidarium in the ground floor courtyard.</p>
<p>While on one hand the Museum runs a range of lively activities, from theatre workshops to observation laboratories, guided and animated tours for students of all ages, to both entertain and teach, on the other hand it seeks to protect itself from visitors who are untrained in the museum experience. This is why it has published an entertaining version of the Ten Commandments called &lsquo;<a href="http://www.museibologna.it/archeologico/documenti/57472">Ten good reasons to not come to the Museum&rsquo;</a> which ends with these words: <em>Forget about abandoned cities, exotic journeys and digs around the world; we do not follow maps of hidden treasures, and the "X" never, never tells you where to dig!</em></p>

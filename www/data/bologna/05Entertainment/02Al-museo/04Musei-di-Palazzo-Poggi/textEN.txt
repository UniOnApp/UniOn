<p><strong>Palazzo Poggi Museums</strong></p>
<p>Palazzo Poggi is a 16<sup>th</sup> century building, once home to Cardinal Giovanni Poggi, (1493-1556), who had it sumptuously decorated by some of the most famous painters and artists of the time (Pellegrino Tibaldi, Giovanni Francesco Bezzi aka &ldquo;il Nosadella&rdquo;, Prospero Fontana). </p>
<p>In 1711 it become the Institute of Science, founded by Luigi Ferdinando Marsili, an extraordinarily stubborn Bolognese character who wanted to give the city a place where all sciences could be studied. &ldquo;<a href="http://www.museopalazzopoggi.unibo.it/131/ilmuseodipalazzopoggi.html">The Institute of Science</a>&rdquo; was the first public institution devoted to scientific research and learning, according to the criteria of direct observation and experimentation&rdquo;: from natural history to archaeology, from chemistry to physics, from astronomy to anatomy, to the applications of mathematics and rational mechanics. In 2000 the University of Bologna reopened the rooms in the palazzo to the public, and today Palazzo Poggi hosts several historical and scientific <a href="http://www.museopalazzopoggi.unibo.it/images/upload/Collezioni/ColleziioniLFMarsili/salaweb.gif-gallery-med-th">museums</a>: Naval and Antiques Maps &amp; Charts Museum, Museum of Military Architecture, Museum of Human Anatomy, Obstetrical Museum, Museum of Natural History, Physics Museum, Museum of Astronomical Observatory (Specola), Room dedicated to oriental art.</p>
<p>The collections are not all from the same period: the Aldrovandi collection, for example, dates back to the 16<sup>th</sup> century; Ulisse Aldrovandi was the first professor of Natural History at the University of Bologna and his belief in &ldquo;learning through direct experience&rdquo; is very similar to that of Marsili. For this reason, in 1742 his collection was taken to the Institute to be observed and studied.</p>
<p>The Archbishop of Bologna Prospero Lambertini, who in 1740 became Pope Benedict XIV, was a very important figure in the development of the Institute. Learned and with a modern mentality, open to debate even with Enlightenment and anticlerical figures, he was a great patron of the sciences in Bologna. Through his papacy, the Institute was able to set up a cutting-edge medical department: the School of Obstetrics.</p>

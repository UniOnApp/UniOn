<p><strong>International Museum of Music</strong></p>
<p>There are ten good reasons to not miss a visit to the International Museum of Music: first of all, a wealth of almost 100,000 documents including scores, sheet music, librettoes, printed books and manuscripts, covering over 5 centuries: you will be able to see Mozart's first music studies (Room 3) when in 1770 he spent the summer in Bologna studying with maestro Padre Giambattista Martini. As well as a rich collection of portraits: Monteverdi, Mozart, J.S. Bach, Haendel, Farinelli, Rossini, Donizetti, Bellini, Verdi, Wagner, and many more; the perfect keyboard, the original&nbsp;<em>Clavemusicum Omnitonum</em>&nbsp;dated 1606 with 125 keys arranged on 5 different rows and 31 keys per octave (Room 4); the first music score in history, the Harmonice Musices Odhecaton A, is found in Bologna, in Room 5; a whole room, number 6, dedicated to opera singers and particularly Farinelli; the signed manuscript of the Barber of Seville by Rossini (room 7); some very special instruments: the Buccina, a curious dragon-shaped trombone and the Armonia di flauti, a polyphonic flute which allowed just one musician play 5 flutes at the same time, or the Tromba marina, a large single-stringed instrument played with a bow ... but which sounds like a trumpet! There is also a collection of lutes and violins; and finally, the beautiful Palazzo Sanguinetti, one of the finest historical buildings that can be visited in Bologna, which has been home to the Museum of Music since 2004. The rooms inside are entirely frescoed with Neoclassical decorations done between the 18<sup>th</sup> and 19<sup>th</sup> centuries: the &ldquo;boschereccia&rdquo; and the Estruscan rooms, the oriental and the neo-Gothic, to the neoclassical ballroom and the delightful Egyptian room.</p>

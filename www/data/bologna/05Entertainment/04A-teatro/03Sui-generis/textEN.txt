<p><strong>Sui generis</strong></p>
<p>One very entertaining show, half way between a play and a sporting event, is <a href="http://www.matchdimprovvisazioneteatrale.it/">theatresports</a>. Ideal for spending an evening with friends. If you are charmed by the stage, you can do an audition and sign up for an amateur training course. The original idea dates back to 1977 and was invented by two Canadian actors, Robert Gravelande&nbsp;Yvon Leduc. It reached Italy only in the late Eighties, in Florence, but then spread rapidly to many other Italian cities. <a href="http://www.matchdimprovvisazioneteatrale.it/bologna.html">Bologna</a> has teams of both amateurs and professionals, and is very active in the organisation of <em>match</em> training courses. </p>
<p>Improvisation in name and in deed. The two teams of 3 or 5 actors have only twenty seconds to prepare the <em>canovaccio</em>, the plot on which their dialogue is based. The <a href="http://www.matchdimprovvisazioneteatrale.it/images/Regolamento.pdf">regulation</a> is very clear: the referee randomly extracts the topic, the number of actor-players, the category and the duration of the improvisation, which is usually just a few minutes. What examples can we give of the topics represented? &lsquo;Theft at the supermarket&rsquo;, three players, two minutes, French-style. Or &lsquo;People who are late for family gatherings&rdquo;, three minutes, five players. <br /> At the end of each improvisation the audience expresses a preference by voting for the most original, or most entertaining, team, by raising coloured cards. At the ticket office, when you buy your ticket you will also be given a slipper! This must be used only in extreme cases: the audience can express its disapproval of a player-actor&rsquo;s interpretation by throwing the slipper onto the stage. <br /> And if you're wondering why the referee is making strange gestures, hitting his heels with a hand or stroking his nose with his thumb or covering his face with his hands, this means that there is some foul play going on. </p>
<p>So, as De Gregori said about a young football player, even in a game of <em>theatresport</em> &lsquo;You can see a player by his courage, altruism and imagination&rsquo;.</p>

<p><strong>Welcome to the theatre...</strong></p>
<p>"Welcome to the theatre. Where everything is fake but nothing is false&hellip;", said <a href="http://www.gigiproietti.it/index.php">Gigi Proietti</a>. In theatrical fiction, reality is represented through the art of acting, a reality interpreted and reconstructed by the actors on stage. Not by chance in many languages the verb &lsquo;act&rsquo; coincides with the verb &ldquo;play&rdquo; (<em>jouer</em> in French, <em>play</em> in English, <em>spielen</em> in German, <em>j&aacute;tszik </em>in Hungarian, играть - <em>igrat'</em> in Russian, etc.).</p>
<p>In Italy the theatre is a much more niche form of artistic and cultural entertainment than the cinema. There are many reasons for this: tickets generally cost more, theatre performances are less advertised and the actors less well known, some genres o representations may be difficult to understand and, to be fully appreciated, require a specific cultural background. <br /> Theatrical genres differ according to the purpose, the production techniques and the contents of the works. Prose theatre refers to tragic theatre (for example one of Shakespeare&rsquo;s tragedies, Sophocles&rsquo; Oedipus Rex), dramatic (Bourgeois, pastoral, romantic, etc.) or comic (a comedy by Goldoni or Moli&egrave;re). If we associate theatrical performance with musical arts, we have opera or lyric theatre (Verdi&rsquo;s <em>La Traviata</em>, Puccini&rsquo;s <em>La Boh&egrave;me</em> or <em>Tosca</em>) and operetta (<em>The merry widow</em> by Leh&aacute;r) or <em>musicals</em>. Variety theatre and cabaret offer light-hearted, entertaining performances sometimes with musical interludes. And to make the most of the local customs, traditions and languages, why not go to see a popular theatre performance in dialect. If on the other hand we refer to the origins of the theatre in specific cultural areas and historical periods, we talk of classic theatre (Greek, Roman), or contemporary theatre<em> (</em>experimental or avant-garde theatre<em>), </em>or oriental theatre (Chinese or Japanese theatre), or animation, or others besides.</p>
<p>At the theatre actors and spectators share the same space and time, they communicate in real time in an exchange of words, gestures, expressions and movements. From tears to laughter, to individual introspection, theatre can arouse the strongest emotions, make you relive stories of the past, and in some cases may even be cathartic. Catharsis, from the Greek word <em>katharsis</em> (purification), from the time of Plato and Aristotle, referred to the liberation of the soul from interior evils. Not by chance, theatrical simulation is applied as a psychotherapeutic technique in drama therapy or art therapy. Artistic interpretation allows us to identify ourselves with events and stories as if they were real, and thus relive their emotions and states of mind.</p>

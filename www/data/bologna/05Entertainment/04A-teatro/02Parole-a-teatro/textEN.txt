<p><strong>Words at the theatre</strong></p>
<p>What happens behind the scenes? Behind the scenes is what the spectator doesn&rsquo;t see: the actors get ready to come on stage, the technicians prepare the scene changes, the prompter whispers the lines to the actors in difficulty. But what exactly happens behind the scenes? The wings - quinta - is the panel or curtain element that demarcates the <a href="https://it.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spazio_scenico">space</a> to the left and right of the stage, i.e. its sides. The expression is also used in common language metaphorically. Anyone who acts &ldquo;behind the scenes&rdquo; does so surreptitiously, without being seen.</p>
<p>A play is divided into acts. At the end of each act the audience can applaud. The strongest applause comes at the end, of course if you enjoyed the <em>play</em>. The acts are separated by an interval or <em>entracte</em>. During the interval the lights come on and the stage remains empty, and sometimes the curtains close. The number of acts depends on the type of drama. During classic operas there are usually five acts, while there are three in the so-called bourgeois tragedy, and perhaps only one act in many contemporary<em> plays</em>. The French term<em> foyer</em> indicates the place where the spectators spend time before the performance or during the intervals. It is usually close to the bar.</p>
<p>To choose which performance best suits your tastes, consult the titles in the <em>Cartellone</em>, i.e. the programme of the artistic season showing at a theatre, or a theatre company or special event. Tickets and season tickets can almost always be purchased on-line on the theatre website. It is a very delicate business choosing your seats, as the prices may vary considerably, as will your view of the stage. The seats in the Stalls are usually the most expensive, and the price also varies according to the position (front rows, central seats, etc.). The seats in the front rows are often reserved for guests of honour and <em>VIPs</em>. The Boxes (Palchetti or even Barcacce, for example at the <a href="http://www.arenadelsole.it/it-IT/Home.aspx">Arena del Sole</a>) are to the sides of the stage, while the Gallery or Balcony are above the stalls, in rows or with small balconies. The seating arrangements are managed by the usher who checks your tickets, helps you find your seat and makes sure that the spectators behave themselves. University students often take jobs as ushers, to make ends meet but also to be able to enjoy the shows.</p>
<p>Theatre is sometimes a 360 degree experience. The Arena del Sole, for example, has begun to collaborate with the Sala Borsa library for public readings of plays before the performance and with AGEA (Association of Parents of Deaf Children) for planning performances with written surtitles, both initiatives could also be very useful for people learning Italian.</p>

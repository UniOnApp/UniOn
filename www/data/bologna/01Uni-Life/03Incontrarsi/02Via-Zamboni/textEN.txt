<p><strong>Via Zamboni</strong></p>
<p>For better or worse, these places are unforgettable, they leave a mark. Piazza Verdi and Via Zamboni are chaotic, packed with students and people coming and going. Early in the morning they are more calm and peaceful. The city wakes up slowly, and the people we meet here have breakfast before they go to lessons or to the office. Then, as the day goes on, the rhythm picks up, the chaos increases and there is a lot of confusion in the evenings, for some people it becomes unbearable at night because of the noise.</p>
<p>Via Zamboni is a historical street in the San Vitale district, which starts at the Two Towers and ends at Porta San Donato, crossing through the university area. It is home to many Palazzi and Departments, including the Department of Classical Philology and Italian Studies, the Department of Philosophy and Communication Studies, the Department of Legal Sciences, as well as the Rectorate, the Palazzo Poggi Museum and many other buildings besides. From the Two Towers to Porta San Donato, this street, with porticoes running from end to end on the left and right, is dotted with squares, where people meet, including Piazza Rossini, Piazza Puntoni and Piazza Verdi.</p>

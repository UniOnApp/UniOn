<p><strong>Via del Pratello</strong></p>
<p>To reach Via del Pratello, on the other hand, go along via Rizzoli and Via Ugo Bassi, leaving the Two Towers behind you. Via del Pratello is a lively &ldquo;popular neighbourhood&rdquo;, well known for its nightlife and characteristic shops selling designer goods, vintage clothing, furniture and food. There are many traditional and cheap wine bars and restaurants, often with lower prices than the average you will find in Bologna.</p>
<p>An article published in the English newspaper Sunday Times, Via del Pratello was described as a bohemian street, in a Bologna that was defined as not only the traditional "educated, red and fat&rdquo; (dotta, rossa e grassa) but also the city of <em>hipsters</em>.</p>

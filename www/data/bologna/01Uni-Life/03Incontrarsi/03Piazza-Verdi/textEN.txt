<p><strong>Piazza Verdi</strong></p>
<p>For better or worse, these places are unforgettable, they leave a mark. Piazza Verdi and Via Zamboni are chaotic, packed with students and people coming and going. Early in the morning they are more calm and peaceful. The city wakes up slowly, and the people we meet here have breakfast before they go to lessons or to the office. Then, as the day goes on, the rhythm picks up, the chaos increases and there is a lot of confusion in the evenings, for some people it becomes unbearable at night because of the noise.</p>
<p>Piazza Verdi, named after the Italian musician Giuseppe Verdi, is often called a contradictory place, full of contrasts. It is a beautiful architectural and artistic square, home to the Municipal Theatre on one side and Palazzo Paleotti and Basilica of San Giacomo Maggiore on the other. Alongside the liveliness of this multicultural crossroads, a place filled with students, local people and traders, there is however also a clear situation of degradation, which makes the area unsafe, particularly at night.</p>

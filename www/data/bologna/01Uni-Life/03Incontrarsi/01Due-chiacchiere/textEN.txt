<p>In Bologna the students enjoy meeting up in the open, particularly in some of the streets and squares around the university, to have a coffee between one lesson and the next, have a chat, or in the evening have an aperitif or take part in any of the many events that are organised.</p>
<p>These places are right in the centre of Bologna, alongside the theatres, historical buildings and monuments you will find copy services, bookshops, bars, pizzerias and all kinds of places to eat and drink. In the warmer seasons (the spring and summer) students can often be found even sitting on the ground, chatting or making music together. Most of this area is pedestrian, where you can go on foot or by bicycle.</p>

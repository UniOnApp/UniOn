<p><strong>Academic life: professors and courses</strong></p>
<p>The professors usually receive students once or twice a week in their Office or Study; days and times are published on the portal page of all the teaching staff, in the Notices section, under &lsquo;Ricevimento&rsquo; (&lsquo;Office hours&rsquo;). Every professor has a pigeon hole which you will usually find at the Department porter's desk, a dedicated space for students to leave written notes and/or documents. The professors have different habits and preferences: consult the web portal to find out more.</p>
<p>The materials used in the lessons (slides, articles, documents) can be shared on two main channels: AMS Campus and Moodle. <a href="https://campus.unibo.it/">AMS Campus</a> is the institutional site for storing teaching material at the University of Bologna&rdquo;. <a href="https://elearning-cds.unibo.it/">Moodle</a> is the University's e-learning platform.</p>
<p>In Italy the academic year begins on 1 November, and is divided into two semesters. However, lessons begin in September or October. Consult the teaching calendar. The academic year is inaugurated during a public ceremony held by the Rector in the Aula Magna Santa Lucia. In AY 2015-2016 the 928<sup>th</sup> academic year was inaugurated dedicated to Umberto Eco. Would you like to see the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vNswlvWfxho">ceremony</a>?</p>

<p><strong>Unibo online</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.unibo.it">University of Bologna</a> website is packed with information in Italian and English about the organisation, teaching and cultural activities of the university, and is updated in real time. Each department has its own website, and publishes information on key research projects, study centres, laboratories and generally about all the activities the department is involved in. Then there are the <a href="http://www.unibo.it/it/ateneo/sedi-e-strutture/scuole">School</a> websites with lots of information on the first and second cycle degree programmes, course units, lesson timetables and of course information about the professors, their fields of research, office hours and so on. For information on the professors and their courses, enter the name in the &lsquo;Rubrica&rsquo; (&lsquo;Address Book&rsquo;) field. If on the other hand you don&rsquo;t know the name of the professor but only the course title, type it into the free field in the top left-hand corner of the unibo.it page and click on Go.</p>
<p>The University of Bologna also has a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/unibo.it">Facebook</a> page and a <a href="https://twitter.com/UniboMagazine">Twitter</a> page used to informally promote the discoveries made during scientific research, the most interesting events - exhibitions, concerts, lectio magistralis, etc. - and lots of other initiatives.</p>
<p>This is an example of a post published on the Facebook page:</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Discover (or rediscover) a 360&deg; view of the courtyards, buildings and gardens of the Alma Mater. From today </em><em>#GoogleStreetView</em><em> comes inside some of the </em><a href="https://www.facebook.com/hashtag/unibo?source=feed_text&amp;story_id=1768996583367668"><em>#Unibo</em></a><em> sites, offering virtual visitors some fascinating &ldquo;all-round&rdquo; images.</em></p>
<p>And here&rsquo;s a short post published on the Twitter page: <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/EventiUnibo?src=hash"><em>#EventiUnibo</em></a><em> From A to &Aring;. Norway: instructions for use. Today, 3.30 p.m.</em></p>
<p>If you get on well in Italian, meaning you read the language well, you will also find some interesting news on the on-line <a href="http://www.magazine.unibo.it/">UNIBO MAGAZINE</a>, talking about the arts, science and humanities - there&rsquo;s something for everyone.</p>
<p>Here are some titles:</p>

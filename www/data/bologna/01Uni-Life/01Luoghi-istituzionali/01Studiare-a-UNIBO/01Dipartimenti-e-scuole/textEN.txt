Some Schools and Departments are in other cities near Bologna: Cesena, Forl&igrave;, Ravenna, Rimini. The Alma Mater Studiorum also has a campus in Buenos Aires. Each School offers a range of first cycle (three-year), second cycle (two-year) or single-cycle (five- or six-year) degree programmes. For example, the School of Psychology and Education Sciences runs 14 (fourteen) different degree programmes while the School of Engineering and Architecture runs 37 (thirty-seven), 9 (nine) of which entirely in the English language.</p>
<p>The Department and the School have different responsibilities: the Department manages scientific research and the School is in charge of the course catalogue, the programmes, lessons and exams. The person responsible for the School is the Presidente (Dean), while the person in charge of the Department is the Director (Head). The highest appointment of every Italian University is the Rettore (Rector).</p>
<p>In Italy the title &ldquo;Dottore&rdquo; or &ldquo;Dottoressa&rdquo; is awarded with the three-year degree. To register for a first cycle degree you need a high school diploma. To register for a PhD programme, you need a second cycle degree and have to pass a public competition. Some specialisations, for example Medicine or Law, have a single-cycle programme, which lasts 5 or 6 years. Students registering for the first year of University are called &ldquo;matricole&rdquo;, &ldquo;freshers&rdquo;.</p>

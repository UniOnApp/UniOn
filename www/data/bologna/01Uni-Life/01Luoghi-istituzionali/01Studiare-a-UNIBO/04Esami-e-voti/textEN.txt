<p><strong>Academic life: exams and grades</strong></p>
<p>There are usually six exam sessions in an academic year, i.e. the dates when you can sit an exam. The autumn session refers to the exams in September/October, the winter session in January/February and the summer session in June/July. The exams may be written, oral or practical. Sometimes, to be admitted to an exam you must produce a written work (such as an essay) or a project and submit it to the professor. Also in this case there is a great variety, depending on the subject taught and the teaching methods chosen by the professor. You can register for an exam using the on-line application <a href="http://almaesami.unibo.it">Alma Esami</a>.</p>
<p>The scores are given out of 30 (thirty). Thirty is the highest score, but it may be given with honours (30 e lode). 18 (eighteen) is a pass, and is the minimum score you must obtain to pass the exam. Every exam is associated to a certain number of learning credits. The higher the number of credits, the more effort you must put in to preparing for the exam. Exams are worth 3, 6, 9 or 12 credits. A credit (CFU) is equivalent to an ECTS credit and usually corresponds to 25 hours of work, including lessons, exercises etc. as well as home study.</p>
<p>The degree score on the other hand is expressed out of one hundred and ten (110) and also in this case it may be given with honours. The minimum score for passing the final examination is 66 (sixty-six). Dissertations are research papers of about 100-150 pages, discussed before a scientific board of professors.</p>

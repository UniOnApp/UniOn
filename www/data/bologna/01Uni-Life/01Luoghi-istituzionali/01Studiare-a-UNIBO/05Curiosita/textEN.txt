<p><strong>Academic life: interesting facts</strong></p>
<p>Some lessons are attended by very many students, and it may be difficult to find a seat. Most of these are lectures, generally theoretical plenary lessons held for the main course units in the degree programme. During these lessons it is not always easy to speak, interact or take the floor. However, workshop lessons are also held for small groups of students.</p>
<p>In Italy students generally ask their friends to keep a seat for them, especially when they don't have much time between one lesson and the next. At the end of the lesson you have to move from one room to another, and the rooms aren&rsquo;t always in the same building.</p>
<p>Moreover, in Italy students often exchange lecture notes, above all when they can&rsquo;t attend a lecture. These are written notes they take as the professor explains the lesson. Some professors also allow you to record the lessons. It is a good idea however to ask their permission first.</p>
<p>In some degree programmes, they still use the academic quarter. The academic quarter is an Italian tradition, which consists in starting the lesson fifteen minutes late, mainly to make it easier to get there before it starts or have a quick coffee or cigarette break between one lesson and the next. In some Schools, however the academic quarter tradition has been abolished, and no longer exists.</p>
<p>When interacting with professors in Italy, you should get to know and use some rules of courtesy, which will make both written and oral communication more polite and smoother. When addressing the professors use the &ldquo;Lei&rdquo; (third person) form and use their surname, saying &lsquo;Professoressa&rsquo; or &lsquo;Professore&rsquo;, or an abbreviation. For example, &ldquo;Buongiorno prof.ssa Conti&rdquo;, &ldquo;Buonasera prof. Principi", or when writing &ldquo;Gent.ma prof.ssa Conti&rdquo;, &ldquo;Gent.mo prof. Divisi&rdquo;.</p>
<p>When you meet them, say &lsquo;Buongiorno, Buonasera, Salve&rsquo; and when you say goodbye, say &lsquo;Arrivederci&rsquo;, &lsquo;A presto&rsquo;. When writing to the professors, perhaps by e-mail, you should use &lsquo;La ringrazio per l&rsquo;attenzione, Cordiali saluti&rsquo; (Thank you for your attention) or &lsquo;Cordialmente&rsquo;, (Kind regards). Always remember to sign your name and surname at the end of the letter.</p>

<p><strong>What to do when you arrive in Bologna</strong></p>
<p>In practical terms, you have to do three important things when you arrive at the University of Bologna. These are the key words: check-in, badge and on-line study plan.</p>
<p>The first thing you must do when you arrive in Bologna is the <em>check-in</em> procedure at the Exchange Students Desk, in via Filippo Re 4, Bologna. You must bring an identity document and a passport photo.</p>
<p>You will register your arrival and receive an appointment for the welcome session, which is usually held in the next day or so. You will attend the welcome session with other exchange students. You will receive the <em>Welcome Kit</em> and general information on the university. You will also find the following documents in your Welcome Kit: your university badge; your Arrival Statement; the instructions for completing the online study plan&rdquo;. (For more information, read the Exchange Students Guide, pp. 15-16)</p>
<p>The badge is your personal university card, with a photo, your student ID number and a magnetic chip. It demonstrates your student status at the University of Bologna. You can use it for many different services, e.g. to enter the university libraries and borrow books, but also to get a discount on cinema tickets, a bus pass or at the university canteens.</p>
<p>The study plan is the list of exams you have to, or choose to sit in order to graduate. Some course units are mandatory and others are optional. The study plan also includes any internship activities. Contact your exchange coordinator to discuss your study plan and sign the <em>Learning Agreement</em>. &ldquo;When you have chosen all the courses you wish to attend at the University of Bologna, according to the approved <em>Learning Agreement</em>, you must complete your online study plan&rdquo;. Visit <a href="http://www.unibo.it/AlmarmStudenti">AlmaRM</a> - Student access, the personal homepage for exchange students. You can change your password, check your personal data and exchange data, manage your contact details and print the acceptance message. [...]&rdquo;.</p>

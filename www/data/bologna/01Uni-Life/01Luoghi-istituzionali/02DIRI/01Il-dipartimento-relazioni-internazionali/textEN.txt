<p>A typical example of 15<sup>th</sup> century Bolognese architecture, <a href="http://www.archiviostorico.unibo.it/it/struttura-organizzativa/sezione-archivio-fotografico/archivi-fotografici-delluniversita/edilizia-universitaria-1930---1950/facolta-di-agraria/palazzina-della-viola-/?IDFolder=203&amp;LN=IT">Palazzina della Viola</a> was founded by Annibale Bentivoglio, where he lived with his family, and was later the residence of other local noble families. In 1803 the building was turned into the School of Agriculture, directed by Filippo Re, by order of the Government of Napoleon. The building houses many frescoes depicting mythological or religious scenes.</p>

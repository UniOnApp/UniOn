<p><strong>Learn Italian and other languages</strong></p>
<p>If you have a strong command of Italian you will be able to make the most of your experience abroad, here in Italy. You will be more independent, confident, you can see shows and listen to local music, interact more in social and cultural life and get around easier. You will also be able to follow the lessons at the University more easily. To find out your language skills level, sit a <a href="http://almaitaliano.cliro.unibo.it">language guidance test</a>.</p>
<p>Every CLA runs Italian courses for international students in the first and second semester. If you wish to attend a course, remember that the first is free of charge and to sign up you must sit an online test, and then have an oral interview. This way you can sign up to the class which is best suited to your Italian language level. </p>
<p>The course ends with an exam. The final grade is &ldquo;pass/fail&rdquo;. The grade is not given out of thirty. Exchange students can obtain 5 credits for attending the first course.

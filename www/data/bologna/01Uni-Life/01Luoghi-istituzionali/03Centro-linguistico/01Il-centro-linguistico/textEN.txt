<p><strong>The University Language Centre</strong></p>
<p>The CLA, <a href="http://www.cla.unibo.it/corsi">University Language Centre</a>, provides language training and skills assessment for students registered at the University of Bologna. The Centre promotes language learning through courses for University of Bologna students and international exchange students. It was the first university language centre in Italy, and was founded in 1971 by linguist Luigi Heilmann, and its historical premises are right in the centre of Bologna, in Piazza San Giovanni in Monte 4.</p>
<p>At the CLA you can attend courses in Arabic, French, English, Spanish and German, or Italian for international students. There is a Centre in Bologna and also in the four Campuses: Forl&igrave;, Cesena, Ravenna and Rimini. Here you will find the secretariat, classrooms and language laboratories for the tests and independent learning activities.</p>
<p>The language courses are run by CEL &ndash; Language experts &ndash; and Language teachers. Check out the web page of your teacher in the University Address Book.</p>
<p>In Bologna, a self-learning service with support is run at the laboratories, were you can find qualified tutors who can help you.</p>
<p>The Language Centre is a lively, multicultural space where you can also get to know many other international students. So don&rsquo;t miss out on the opportunities available at the University Language Centre! </p>

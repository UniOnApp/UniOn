<p><strong>More than just books</strong></p>
<p>Originally the library was the place that collected and preserved books and other works for studies. Today the libraries are increasingly multi-purpose spaces where students can not only study, consult and borrow, but can also take part in many other activities.</p>
<p>Some libraries in Bologna are located in historical Museums and Buildings (including the Archiginnasio, the Sala Borsa, the University Library, etc.). In terms of organisation, the Bologna libraries are either <a href="http://www.bibliotechebologna.it/">municipal</a>, managed by the Municipalities or <a href="http://www.sba.unibo.it/it/">university libraries</a> run by the University. Then there are the <a href="http://www.unibo.it/it/servizi-e-opportunita/biblioteche-risorse-digitali-e-sale-studio/sale-studio-a-bologna">study rooms</a>, spaces, as their name indicates, made available to students to study and prepare for exams. They are often independent from the libraries and have different opening times.</p>
<p>Every library has its own special features. In most cases, in addition to books you can borrow CDs, DVDs, tourist guides, or take part in a range of cultural events and exhibitions. Rooms are also available in the libraries for meetings, film viewings, playing games and listening to music.</p>
<p>To search for works, books, journals and so on, you can use the unified <a href="http://sbn-ubo.unibo.it/">OPAC Sebina</a> online service which catalogues a total of 3,104,045 documents and 1,932,200 titles. All documents and titles have a specific position, i.e. an ID code that makes them easier to find. You can find what you're looking for by author or title, or by using simple key words.</p>
<p>And there&rsquo;s good news for night owls and workaholics: some of the study rooms and libraries are open until late in the evening and during the weekend. Do you know who &ldquo;night owls&rdquo; and &ldquo;workaholics&rdquo; are? The first refers to people who enjoy the night, stay up late to have fun or study, while the second refers to anyone who spends a lot of time working or studying.</p>
<p>If you like reading e-books and online journals, and Italian and foreign magazines, music and videos, databases and so on, the <a href="https://bologna.medialibrary.it/home/cover.aspx">MediaLibraryOnLine</a> services are the right choice for you. It&rsquo;s the digital library of Bologna and you just need to be registered in one of the public libraries of Bologna and ask for username and password to access its services.</p>

<p>What about you, do you study better in the library or at home? Do you concentrate better in the evening, at night or during the day? Have you already got your library card?</p>

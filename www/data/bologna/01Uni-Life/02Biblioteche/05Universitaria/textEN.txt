<p><strong>University Library</strong></p>
<p>At the University Library you will find yourself in a museum of immense beauty, or rather several museums of immense beauty: Museo Marsili, Museo Aldrovandi, the Quadreria, the Aula Magna: all these places bear witness to the historical and artistic heritage of this place. The Library, the entrance to which is in Via Zamboni 35, has 1,384,112 volumes and non-book materials including manuscripts, incunables, 16<sup>th</sup> century books, periodicals, etc.</p>
<p>There are three consultation rooms in the Library, with a total of 200 seats. These rooms house shelves with books that can be consulted without having to request them from the librarian. Then there are other specialised consultation rooms.</p>
<p>Some strict rules are in place for the consultation of manuscripts, antique books, rare and other precious works: you must be at least 18, present an identity document and state your intentions, i.e. explain why you wish to consult the works. &ldquo;You may ask for four manuscripts at a time, and not more than eight volumes&rdquo;. To &ldquo;protect particularly rare and previous documents or those which are not in a good state of conservation&rdquo;, a reproduction of the original is usually made available. &ldquo;The reader is responsible for the works taken out until they are returned; if you leave the room even for a short time, the work must be returned to the librarian. Material distributed in the room cannot be taken outside the room for any reason whatsoever&rdquo;.</p>

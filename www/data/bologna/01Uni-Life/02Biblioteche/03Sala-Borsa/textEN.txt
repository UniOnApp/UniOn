<p><strong>Sala Borsa: a multi-purpose space</strong></p>
<p>Sala Borsa is a multimedia library housed in Palazzo d&rsquo;Accursio, an &ldquo;almost-castle&rdquo; that used to house the Municipality of Bologna, in Piazza del Nettuno, right next to Piazza Maggiore. The library opened in 2001 but the modern, avant-garde building that is its home today was built from iron and glass in the late 19<sup>th</sup> century, to house the Bologna Stock Exchange and the city&rsquo;s trade centre. In turn, this building stands on the archaeological remains of centuries of history, and the Roman excavations visible below the crystal floor in the Main Hall, the &ldquo;Piazza Coperta&rdquo;, bear witness to this.</p>
<p>The Sala Borsa is visited by over a million people every year, and is an eclectic place and an expression of culture and citizenship. The Sala Borsa covers 4 floors, where you can consult books, journals, newspapers from many countries, tourist guides, CDs and DVDs, watch films, documentaries, TV series or access materials and resources to learn 42 different languages. The basement is home to a very well stocked children&rsquo;s library and an <em>Auditorium</em> that hosts exhibitions, conferences and cultural events. The ground floor, where the Piazza Coperta is, is home to the &ldquo;traditional&rdquo; library, offering registration, lending and book return services. Here there is also a children&rsquo;s library and a nursery area. In the right wing of Piazza Coperta, an elegant Caf&eacute; has plenty of tables and a piano available to players wishing to give a public display of their musical skills. Newspapers, journals and tourist guides are on the first floor, next to the reading rooms. The second floor houses the Bologna <em>Urban Center</em>.</p>
<p>And if you don&rsquo;t fancy studying, there&rsquo;s plenty more to do: you can take part in a guided tour of the archaeological excavations, join a reading group (there&rsquo;s a group dedicated to thriller literature!) or take part in the &lsquo;Scioglilingua&rsquo;, a free conversation service with mother-tongue speakers.</p>

<p>Here are some opinions of the Library users. User is a synonym of visitor, frequenter, anyone registered for a service, such as the library services.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Very nice. Beautiful inside and out. It covers many floors with different sections: library, children&rsquo;s area, a hall for exhibitions and meetings. It&rsquo;s great to be able to sit at a table and speak different languages with strangers.</p>
<p>The outside is marvellous too, looking out over Piazza Maggiore and Nettuno, there is a pretty garden at the back where you can sit and have a sandwich on a bench&rdquo;.</p>
<p>&ldquo;A meeting point for students or simply readers. A beautiful, historical location, worth a visit just to take a look.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The place has a beautiful atmosphere. The study rooms are always packed, so get there at opening time if you want to get a place. The library is well stocked, it has wifi, a document library, a bar, children's library and Internet stations. Books are lent on a self-service basis, the process is very fast compared to other libraries where you have to wait.&rdquo;</p>

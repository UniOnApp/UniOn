<p><strong>The Archiginnasio Municipal Library</strong></p>
<p>You may well find it difficult to study at the Archiginnasio Library. There are so many visual stimuli from the artistic delights of this historical building. Every inch of the walls of this magnificent 16<sup>th</sup> century architecture is covered with decorations, frescoes, coats of arms, inscriptions and engravings.</p>
<p>&ldquo;The external portion of the palace has a long portico of 30 arches and is pronounced in two internal floors around a <a href="http://www.archiginnasio.it/cortile.htm">central courtyard</a> with a double order of loggias. <br /> Two grand <a href="http://www.archiginnasio.it/scaloni.htm">staircases</a> lead to the <a href="http://www.archiginnasio.it/loggiato.htm">floor above</a> that has 10 <a href="http://www.archiginnasio.it/sale.htm">lecture rooms</a> (which cannot be visited today as they are used as the Library&rsquo;s main store rooms) and two lecture halls at the ends of the building, one for the Artists (today the Library&rsquo;s Reading Room) and one for the Legisti (also known as the <a href="http://www.archiginnasio.it/stabat.htm">Sala dello Stabat Mater</a>)&rdquo;.</p>

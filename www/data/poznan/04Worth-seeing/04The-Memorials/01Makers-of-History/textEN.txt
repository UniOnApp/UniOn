<p>1956 Uprising Monument, widely known as the &ldquo;Poznań Crosses&rdquo;, today is one of the symbols of the city. The monument is situated in the center of the city, next to the Adam Mickiewicz Monument. It <strong>was erected to commemorate</strong> <strong>the political events</strong> of June 1956 when a <strong>general strike and street demonstrations</strong> took place <strong>in protest against the communist authorities</strong>. The strikes first occurred in the biggest industrial plants in Poznań and were followed by thousands of workers protesting at the streets of the city. <strong>The protesters&rsquo;</strong> major <strong>demands</strong> concerned the <strong>withdrawal of the imposed efficiency rates, lowering the prices of goods and increasing wages</strong>. The authorities decided on using military and police forces t<strong>o suppress the demonstrations</strong>, which resulted in several dozen of people dying in the fights.</p>
<p>The Poznań Crosses were officially unveiled on the 25<sup>th</sup> anniversary of these events, on June 28<sup>th</sup>, 1981. </p>
<p>The monument <strong>consists of</strong> two 19,5 and 21 meters metal crosses (symbolizing death and resurrection) and an eagle head sculpture. The 1956 date on the left cross refers to the Poznań Uprising, while the 1968, 1970, 1976, 1980 and 1981 dates on the right cross refer to other historical events in the Polish struggle for independence. The <strong>protesters&rsquo; slogans</strong> are inscribed on right side of the monument: &ldquo;We want God, for freedom, justice and bread&rdquo; and &ldquo;June 1956&rdquo;.&nbsp;</p>

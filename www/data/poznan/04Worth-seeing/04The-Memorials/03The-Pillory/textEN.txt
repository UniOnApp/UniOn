<p>There is one place at the Old Market, which once <strong>inspired fear and trepidation</strong>. No one was <strong>willing</strong> to get near it. Nowadays though, when you&rsquo;ll be around, <strong>stop by for a moment</strong> to see the place where <strong>criminals were punished for their crimes</strong>.</p>
<p>The place you will find on the south-eastern <strong>corner </strong>of the Town Hall is called <strong><em>Pręgież &ndash; </em>the pillory</strong>. It is an octagonal late Gothic <strong>column</strong>, at the top of which stands a <strong>statue of an executioner</strong> in a <strong>knight</strong>&rsquo;s outfit, holding a raised sword. The sword symbolizes the so-called &ldquo;right of the sword&rdquo; (in Latin <em>ius gladii</em>) i.e. the <strong>right to issue capital punishment</strong>, given to the authorities of Poznań in 1298 by the then king Władysław the Short. The pillory was erected at this spot in 1535. <strong>The funds</strong> for the construction <strong>were provided from fines</strong> paid by the servants, wet-nurses and tavern owners&rsquo; wives for <strong>wearing too elegant clothing</strong> for instance too much gold jewelry, pearls or silver, or overfolded dresses.</p>
<p>Fixed to the pillar were iron hoops, to which the <strong>convicts</strong> were tied. The pillory was a punitive site where chastisement like <strong>lashing</strong>, cutting off ears, fingers, or hands, was performed. Public castigations <strong>took place</strong> until 1848. <strong>They were ruled</strong> out by Prussian law on May 6, 1848.</p>
<p>The 5,5 meter high monument was allegedly made by an Italian sculptor. </p>

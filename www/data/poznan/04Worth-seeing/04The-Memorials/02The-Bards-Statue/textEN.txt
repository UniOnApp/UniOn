<p>Adam Mickiewicz is <strong>one of the greatest Polish poets</strong> whose works are known all over the world. </p>
<p>It was indeed in Poznań where the first <strong>monument to the Romantic bard</strong> on Polish lands was erected. Adam Mickiewicz <strong>stayed</strong> in Poznań and the Greater Poland region from August 1831 to March 1832. The poet came here with the intention to <strong>cross the</strong> Prussian-Russian <strong>border in secret</strong> and join <strong>the November insurgents</strong>. Although he had made a few attempts, he didn&rsquo;t manage to get through to the insurgents.</p>
<p>After the poet&rsquo;s death on November 26<sup>th</sup>, 1855, a committee, which tasked itself with the <strong>organization of the funeral observances</strong>, was formed in Poznań. Soon funds were raised to erect a <strong>monument to the poet</strong>. Władysław Oleszczyński was chosen to sculpt the monument, as he had known Adam Mickiewicz in person before the poet&rsquo;s death. The monument was <strong>unveiled</strong> on May 7, 1859. The sculptor depicted Mickiewicz in a standing position, with his left hand pressing a piece of paper to the rock, and a coat in his right hand. </p>
<p>The monument did not survive the war. It was destroyed by the Germans in 1939. </p>
<p>The inhabitants of Poznań made sure to <strong>commemorate the poet</strong> with all honors and began attempts to <strong>rebuild the statue</strong>. A new monument was moulded in Katowice and unveiled on May 29, 1960. The 4-meter figure standing on a 2-meter base towers over the surrounding area.</p>
<p>The statue is situated on Adam Mickiewicz Square, next to the 1956 Uprising Monument, just next to AMU Collegium Minus. </p>

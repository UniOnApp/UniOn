<p>The largest rectangular square in the center of the city, surrounded by many <strong>representative buildings</strong>, which house banks, companies, and boutiques, is the <strong>Freedom Square.</strong> For many years the place&rsquo;s emptiness had been scaring people off and the square was only used for <strong>mass gatherings and public events</strong>. Nowadays, thanks to its restoration to the appearance resembling the interwar period, it is also a popular place for the inhabitants of Poznań. The trees, lawns, flowerbeds and benches are <strong>inviting you to take a break.</strong> <strong>The Fountain of Freedom</strong>, one of Poznanians&rsquo; particularly favorite spots, constructed in 2012 according to the design of Agnieszka Stochaj and Rafał Nowak, is a haven in the<strong> urban chaos</strong>. The water flows over the monumental glass sails and <strong>offers refreshment</strong> on a hot day. A walk inside the fountain, while you&rsquo;re surrounded by the humming water, is <strong>quite sensational</strong>. When it&rsquo;s really hot, don&rsquo;t hesitate to sit on one of the wooden ramps and <strong>wet your feet</strong>, that&rsquo;s what the ramps were designed for!</p>
<p>Nearby stands a much older <strong>fountain of Higeia</strong>. Although quite modest in style, the fountain <strong>has a special meaning</strong> for Poznanians, due to the fact that it was founded by a prominent inhabitant of Poznań, a social activist and philanthropist, count Edward Raczyński, to crown the building of city water supply system, of which he was a major sponsor. The statue of the <strong>goddess of health and hygiene</strong> has features of the founder&rsquo;s wife, Constance. Located behind the monument is <strong>the Raczyński Library</strong>, one of the most important and oldest institution of culture and education in Poznań. The edifice, built between 1822 and 1829, with a characteristic fa&ccedil;ade embellished with 12 columns that refer to the Louvre, was founded and donated to the city by count Raczyński. A major and valuable book collection was donated to the library by his wife Constance.</p>
<p>At the other side of the square you can admire other 19th century buildings, for instance the neo-Baroque Peasantry Bank (pl. Wolności 9), or the Art Noveau house of the Brandts&rsquo; family (pl. Wolności 8).</p>
<p><strong>Something you can&rsquo;t miss</strong> while you&rsquo;re at the Freedom Square <strong>is the Hotel Bazar</strong> (ul. Paderewskiego 8, Al. Marcinkowskiego 10) &ndash; one of the most significant buildings in Poznań, <strong>built on the initiative of</strong> Poznań social activists and patriots. The edifice was erected in the first half of the 19th century, not only <strong>for </strong>commercial <strong>purposes</strong>, but also with the intention to promote Polish culture. The Hotel Bazar housed Polish merchants&rsquo; shops, newspaper, and various associations. Numerous outstanding Polish writers, artists, social activists and politicians had visited the hotel over the ages. The neo-Baroque wing facing the Freedom Square was designed by count Raczyński. The older neo-Classicist wing is located at Paderewskiego st.</p>
<p><strong>If you&rsquo;re in for some cultural entertainment</strong>, nothing could be more simple! <strong>The National Museum in Poznań</strong> is located at the other side of the street (al. Marcinkowskiego 9). Built in 1904, the <strong>monumental edifice</strong> was designed by Carl Hinckeldeyn and <strong>inspired by</strong> Berlin Arsenal. Now <strong>it is occupied by</strong> the Art &amp; Sculpture Gallery, featuring collections of world class paintings by, for instance, Claude Monet, Lucas Cranach the Elder, Diego Vel&aacute;zquez, as well as Polish art by Jacek Malczewski, Olga Boznańska, or Stanisław Wyspiański, and others.</p>
<p>The large <strong>Arcadia building</strong> containing the Empik chain store, Theatre of the Eight Day, and City Information Center. The building was erected in the 19<sup>th</sup> century as a German Municipal Theatre. It owes its modern shape to C&auml;sar Stenzl. The most characteristic element of the edifice, visible from the square, is the column portico designed by Heinrich Hermann. There is a caf&eacute; at the vast entrance from which you can admire the whole square.</p>
<p>The area is a place where various events, <strong>occasional fairs, temporary exhibitions, summer movie screenings and outside performances </strong>are organized. It is also a <strong>convenient spot</strong> for concerts and broadcasts of sport events. In the winters a skate-rink opens on the square, while in the summer time it turns into a beach. There&rsquo;s a multi-storey car park under the square.</p>

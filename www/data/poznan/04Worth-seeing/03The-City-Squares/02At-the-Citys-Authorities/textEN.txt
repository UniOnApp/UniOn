<p>Although the Collegiate Square <strong>might not seem too interesting at first sight</strong>, <strong>it is worth a visit</strong> to take a look at the frontage of the buildings encircling its space. The shape and name of the square <strong>commemorate</strong> the Collegiate of St. Mary Magdalene, which had been located there, but was torn down in 1802. The square is directly connected with the <strong>Jesuit College</strong>, whose <strong>vast</strong> characteristic white and pink <strong>buildings</strong> can be seen from at least few spots: from the perspective of the Old Market Square (looking from Świętosławska st.), from Podg&oacute;rna st. (through the Chopin&rsquo;s Square) and at the Collegiate Square. The former Jesuit College <strong>is</strong> now <strong>the seat of</strong> the Poznań City Hall, the City Council and the Mayor of the City.</p>
<p>The Jesuit College was built in the years 1701 &ndash; 1733 according to the project of Giovanni Catenazzi. The building is a three-story horseshoe-shaped building with an <strong>inner courtyard</strong> and characteristic fa&ccedil;ade dominated by the repeating rhythm of cornices and pilasters. The newest part of the complex is the <strong>entrance gate</strong> (straight ahead Kozia st.), with a tower at its end. Inside the tower are three <strong>bells</strong>: Bogurodzica, St. Joseph, and St. Antoni. Bogurodzica is the medieval name given to the Mother of Jesus and the oldest religious song written in Polish. There was one more church included in the <strong>cloister complex</strong>, the Parish Church of Our Lady of Perpetual Help and St. Mary Magdalene in Poznań, i.e. <strong>Poznań Fara</strong>, which <strong>has inherited the patron</strong> after the older church, which was located at the square, subjected to <strong>historical</strong> and weather<strong> cataclysms</strong>.</p>
<p>The Jesuit College existed since the 17th century and was one of the two institutions of higher education in Poznań. The first rector was <strong>Jakub Wujek, </strong>the author of the first <strong>translation</strong> of the Bible <strong>to Polish</strong>. In the 18th century, after the dissolution of the Jesuit Order, the Collegium was combined with the Lubrański Academy. <strong>AMU</strong> refers to the tradition of both these schools. It is believed <strong>the tradition also lives in</strong> the St. Mary Magdalene High School.</p>
<p>Nowadays, the post-Jesuit complex is not only a center of secular and spiritual authorities, but also entertainment. <strong>If you get tired of sightseeing</strong>, step in the Caf&eacute; Misja (1 Gołębia st.) or, the Republic of Roses, located at the Collegiate Square. Both <strong>cafes</strong> offer not only an <strong>original menu</strong>, but also <strong>food for thought</strong>: meetings with the creators of art, concerts, etc. When you sit in the outside garden of the Republic of Roses, you will <strong>surely</strong> <strong>take notice of</strong> the curved residential layout on the eastern side of the square, duplicating the shape of the <strong>medieval city walls</strong>.</p>
<p>Besides, the <strong>tourists can acquaint themselves with</strong> <strong>the mascots of the city</strong> - the replicas of two figures of billy-goats butting on the cornice of the Town Hall. The <strong>monument to the goats</strong> was placed on the square thanks to the project of Robert Sobociński. As the golden glitter of their horns suggests, touching them <strong>brings luck</strong>.</p>

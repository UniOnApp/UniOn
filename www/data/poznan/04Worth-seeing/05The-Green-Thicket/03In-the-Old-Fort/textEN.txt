<p>The biggest park in the city, spread on the area of 100 ha, called the Citadel Park, is <strong>a must-see landmark on the map </strong>of Poznań.</p>
<p>The park was built between 1963 and 1970, where the fortress Winiary was located before the World War II. In 2008 the Citadel Park was <strong>labeled one of Poland&rsquo;s Historic Monuments.</strong></p>
<p>You can enter the park from the Armii Poznań Av., climbing the monumental stairs, at the top of which you&rsquo;ll see the 23 meters high Heroes&rsquo; Monument, unveiled on February 23, 1946, on the first anniversary of freeing Poznań from German occupation.</p>
<p>Some parts of the park are <strong>clear evidence of various historical events</strong>. There are a few cemeteries, such as the Poznań Old Garrison Cemetery, Polish Military Cemetery, Russian Military Cemetery, Orthodox Cemetery, et alia. There are <strong>graves of veterans</strong>, soldiers, victims of the Hitler&rsquo;s and Stalin&rsquo;s terror, as well as <strong>mass graves of</strong> Russian and French <strong>prisoners of war</strong>.</p>
<p>The citadel fortifications are occupied by two museums (Museum of Armaments and the Poznań Army Museum) and <strong>sections</strong> of the Greater Poland <strong>Museum</strong> of the Battles for Independence.</p>
<p>The remaining <strong>fortress structures</strong> are also worth seeing, for instance:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ravelin I &ndash; a demi-lune triangular fortification, built in front of the <strong>fortress&rsquo;</strong> defense line</li>
<li><strong>Redout</strong> - a closed, stand-alone field or semi-permanent fortification, having a circular, rectangular or polygonal shape, in which soldiers could independently defend themselves</li>
<li><strong>Bastion</strong> II</li>
<li>The Little Lock (<em>Kleine Schleuse</em>) and the Great Lock (<em>Gro&szlig;e Schleuse</em>)</li>
</ol>
<p>While taking a walk in the park, <strong>it is also worth</strong> having a peek <strong>at </strong>the Heroes&rsquo; Monument, the amphitheater, the Bell of Peace and Friendship between the Nations, and the rosarium.</p>
<p>The <em>Unrecognized</em> <strong>installation</strong> from 2002, created by Magdalena Abakanowicz, located <strong>in the central part of the park</strong>, near the Museum of Armaments, is also an essential thing to see. The installation consisting of 112 iron 2-meter high figures resembling headless human silhouettes will surely impress you.</p>

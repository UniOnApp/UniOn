<p>Adam Mickiewicz Park is one of the <strong>historic parks in Poznań</strong>, located in the <strong>Imperial District</strong> at the junction of Fredry, Wieniawskiego, Św. Marcin streets and Niepodległości Av. It was created in the years 1907 - 1910 on the grounds of the <strong>former city fortifications</strong>. Although rather small, it&rsquo;s <strong>outstandingly lovely</strong>. It combines architectural and garden elements. The park&rsquo;s composition is deliberately linked to the Moniuszko Grand Theatre. If you stand on the elevated northern edge of the park, <strong>you&rsquo;ll be able to admire</strong> the magnificent, <strong>carefully planned perspective</strong>: the <strong>colorful flowerbeds</strong> encircling the pond, the impressive fountain which symmetrically cuts the view on the Neoclassicist edifice of the Theatre (situated across Fredry st.) and the <strong>monumental staircase</strong>, which <strong>seems to be</strong> emerging from the water.</p>
<p><strong>If you are seeking a respite</strong> from university classes, you may easily <strong>lie down on the grass</strong>, just like many Poznanians do &ndash; <strong>sit on a bench and enjoy a good read</strong>, or even, following the children&rsquo;s example, wade in the pond for refreshment on a <strong>hot day</strong>. The lane surrounding the park let&rsquo;s you encircle the park in the tree shadows, the colorful flowerbeds <strong>are a sight for sore eyes</strong>. On the stairs you can frequently come across students and teachers enjoying <strong>outdoor</strong> classes outside university walls on a warm June day. Enthusiasts of yoga meet every Sunday to practice asanas <strong>under instructor&rsquo;s guidance</strong> in these <strong>beautiful surroundings</strong>.</p>

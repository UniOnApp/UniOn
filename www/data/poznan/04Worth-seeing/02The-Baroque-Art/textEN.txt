<p>When you will be <strong>hanging out</strong> in the vicinity of the Old Market Square, <strong>don&rsquo;t miss out on</strong> the characteristic pink and white fa&ccedil;ade facing the Świętosławska st. It is the Poznań Collegiate Church, whose full name <strong>can be quite overwhelming</strong>: <strong>the Parish Church of Our Lady of Perpetual Help, and St. Mary Magdalene in Poznań</strong>. Poznanians simply call it &ldquo;<strong>Fara</strong>&rdquo;, which means (from German) <strong>parish church</strong>. In 2010 it <strong>was given the honorary title</strong> of Basillica Minor, granted to churches of <strong>unique value</strong>. The Collegiate Church had been built for over 50 years, at the turn of 17th and 18th centuries, for the needs of the <strong>Jesuit College</strong>. The remaining edifices of the College are situated at the Collegiate Square.</p>
<p><strong>If you look closely</strong>, over the portico you can see the sculpture of Ignatius of Loyola, the founder of the Jesuit Order.</p>
<p>The Collegiate Church prides itself on being the &ldquo;<strong>pearl of Baroque</strong>&rdquo;. The consecutive restoration of the sacral building <strong>reveals the magnificence of this historical monument</strong>. The church was built <strong>on a cruciform groundplan</strong> and the edifice is shaped in the form of a three-ailed basilica with a transept. The fa&ccedil;ade, which alludes to the shape of ll Ges&ugrave;, was designed at the end of the 18th century by Bartłomiej Natanial Wąsowki. It has three floors embellished with numerous sculptures of saints: the middle depicts saints from the Poznań diocese, while the top portrays saints from the Jesuit Order. The church <strong>features many elements characteristic of the Baroque style</strong>: illusionistic ceiling painting (among others the trompe l&rsquo;oeil dome), stucco work, and the artificial marble columns. The altar was designed by Pompeo Ferrari and presents the figures of church&rsquo;s patrons &ndash; St. Stanisław the Bishop and St. Stanisław Kostka. The ceiling paintings in the main nave tell the story of the former saint. The church has side-chapels, a loggia and an organ loft.</p>
<p>The Poznań Collegiate Church is however <strong>best known for its pipe organ</strong>, made by a world famous master <strong>Friedrich Ladegast </strong>in the years 1872-1876. <strong>If you are a fan of sacral music</strong>, <strong>don&rsquo;t pass on the opportunity to visit the church on a Saturday</strong>. It&rsquo;s been 20 years now since the weekly Saturday concerts have been organized. The Poznań Collegiate Church concert begins at 12.15 p.m. and you can listen to the greatest virtuosos of organ music.</p>
<p>If you are lucky enough (or unlucky, depending how you look at it), maybe you&rsquo;ll spot the Black Lady &ndash; the ghost of the <strong>anonymous founder of the instrument</strong>.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Magdalena&rsquo;s Braid&rdquo; Fair, a competition for the longest braid, accompanied by many other interesting contests and performances, <strong>has also</strong> <strong>become a traditional event</strong>.</p>
<p>A bustling inter-parish Roman-Catholic organization works by the church.</p>

<p>The 14th-century <strong>Town Hall</strong> gained its Renaissance fa&ccedil;ade in the 16th century, the design concept of Giovanni Battista di Quadro. <strong>Considered one of the most remarkable Renaissance buildings in Central Europe</strong>, the edifice impresses with its monumental fa&ccedil;ade, three-storey loggia, colorful polychromy and a watchtower. The Town Hall can be seen as an encrypted allegory of history, civic rights, social order, ethics, and power. Take a closer look at the women sculptures. You can recognize <strong>Patience</strong> (portrayed with a sheep), <strong>Prudence</strong> (holding a mirror), <strong>Love</strong> (with two children), <strong>Justice</strong> (with scales), <strong>Faith </strong>(with a chalice and a sword), <strong>Hope</strong> (with censer and the sun), <strong>Courage</strong> (with a broken column), and <strong>Moderation</strong> (a woman pouring water from a jug to a bowl). The medallions depict ancient figures looking upon the city inhabitants: Virgil, Horace, Justinian the Great, et al. Latin inscriptions remind the tradition of the &ldquo;city republic&rdquo;. A <strong>legend says</strong> that under the cover of night Polish kings leave their Town Hall renderings to watch the changing city. <strong>You should definitely listen to the story of the wounded king and the bird intervention that saved the city</strong>. At the top of the tower you&rsquo;ll notice a spread-winged eagle, which is a specific <strong>time capsule</strong> with relics of local history. At noon look up at the <strong>butting billy goats</strong>, described in a separate section. They were first known as a jester mechanism. If you&rsquo;re staying in Poznań for longer, notice the goats&rsquo; attire &ndash; they get dressed up on various urban celebrations. </p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t miss the opportunity to see the Town Hall from afar to notice the significant displacement in regards to the merchants&rsquo; and tenement houses. An architect&rsquo;s mistake, perhaps? No, it was an intended endeavor to bring the Town Hall edifice into prominence, display the <strong>symbol of affluence</strong>, the manifest of city&rsquo;s greatness.</p>
<p>Nowadays the Town Hall houses the <strong>Museum of the History of Poznań</strong>. On your visit be sure to notice the Royal Room, where city council meetings were held, and the Grand Vestibule, where city court sessions took place.</p>

<p>The small, compact, colorful, narrow, often <strong>single-window houses</strong> at the Old Market Square are nothing like the ornate Krak&oacute;w Cloth Hall, but they still catch the visitors&rsquo; eye. They are the <strong>remnants of the city structure and trade buildings</strong> <strong>in the Middle Ages</strong>. The edifices were called <strong>the merchant houses or herring booths</strong>. Under the arcades the merchants sold their goods: fish, salt, torches, candles, linen and&hellip; tar. The former wooden stalls were replaced by the little <strong>enchanting souvenir shops</strong>, where you can meet local artists showcasing their works as well as find <strong>unique handicrafts</strong>. The merchants&rsquo; guild coat of arms (a herring and three palm trees) can be found on the fa&ccedil;ade of house no. 17. You should definitely take a walk on the shortest street in the city, the Kurzanoga street, located behind the merchant houses. The place is particularly teeming with crowds during the <strong>St. John&rsquo;s Fair</strong>.</p>

<p>The Archcathedral Basilica of St. Peter and St. Paul, which is the official <strong>name of the Poznań cathedral</strong>, is considered to be the oldest and one of the most important sacral buildings in Poland, no wonder it was honored the title of minor basilica. The church&rsquo;s patrons are the city&rsquo;s patrons as well, their images appear on the crest of Poznań. The Cathedral was built on Ostr&oacute;w Tumski, a tiny island on the Warta river, which was home to a <strong>ducal settlement</strong>, part of which was the pre-Romanesque cathedral founded in 968. Nowadays, the <strong>Cathedral Island</strong> is occupied, among others, by the Archdiocesan Museum in the 16th century <strong>Lubrański Academy</strong> building, the oldest university college in Poznań. If you want to see the predecessor of AMU, it&rsquo;s as easy as that! Besides, the Cathedral Island is probably the place where duke Mieszko I was baptized, which lead to the <strong>Christianization of the whole country</strong>. Archeologists believe that the 10th c. bowl in the church&rsquo;s cellar might be the stone baptismal font of the first historical ruler of Poland. It is also <strong>the burial place of the first Polish rulers</strong>, including the first Polish king, Boleslaus the Brave. The remains of the sarcophagi can be seen in the crypt of the basilica.</p>
<p>The church you&rsquo;re seeing today is a post-war <strong>reconstruction of the Gothic edifice</strong> from the 14th and 15th centuries. Take notice of the 19th century Golden Chapel, built to commemorate the first Polish rulers. The cathedral is the first landmark on <strong>the Royal-Imperial Route</strong>.</p>
<p>You can stroll down along the Jordan&rsquo;s Bridge from the Cathedral Island to the <strong>Śr&oacute;dka</strong> district, which has become a trendy meeting spot after its revitalization. It is home to the most modern museum in <strong>Poznań &ndash; ICHOT Porta Posnania</strong>. This facility was awarded the title of one of the 7 Tourist Miracles of Poland in the National Geographic contest in 2014.</p>

<p>At the top of the St. Adalbert&rsquo;s Hill stands a church dedicated to the saint. A legend says that on this very hill St. Adalbert preached a sermon before he set off to pagan Prussia. The 15th century <strong>Gothic church</strong> had been rebuilt over the ages &ndash; two side naves were added in the 16th century, while gables and a chapel were built in the 17th century. The last changes were made in the beginning of the 20th century, when Art Nouveau polychromy and stained glass windows were added, inspired by the interiors of St. Mary&rsquo;s Basillica in Cracow. Sadly, the church was heavily damaged during the World War II, and what we can see now is the combination of the remains and the post-war reconstruction of the sacral edifice. The <strong>stellar and ribbed vaults</strong> (in the south nave), as well as the partly saved <strong>polychromies by Antoni Procajłowicz,</strong> are worth noticing. The most relevant historic monuments are the 16th century <strong>stone baptismal font</strong> with fragments of polychromies and coffin portraits of the family Naramowiccy, characteristic of the 17th and 18th century Polish culture and art. In front of the church stands a modest <strong>15th century tower bell</strong>, the oldest wooden monument in Poznań.</p>
<p>The particular importance of St. Adalbert&rsquo;s church is emphasized by the presence of the <strong>Crypt of Merit</strong>, founded in 1923. The remains of the distinguished Poles were laid in the crypt, among others, the ashes of <strong>J&oacute;zef Wybicki</strong>, the composer of Polish national anthem, <strong>Feliks Nowowiejski</strong>, an outstanding composer, <strong>Heliodor Święcicki</strong>, the first rector of the Poznań University, and <strong>Henryk Dąbrowski</strong>, the founder of Legions of Dąbrowski in Italy. A sarcophagus of <strong>Karol Marcinkowski</strong>, a distinguished doctor and social activist, can also be found inside the church.</p>
<p><strong>Sightseeing the Crypt of Merit is free upon previous notice in the parish bureau.</strong></p>

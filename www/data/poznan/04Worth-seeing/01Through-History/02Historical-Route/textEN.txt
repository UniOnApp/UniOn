<p><strong>The Royal-Imperial Route</strong> reconstructs <strong>the history of the city</strong> and its inhabitants. Marked by a characteristic logo of a <strong>crown</strong>, it will <strong>guide</strong> you <strong>to the city&rsquo;s historical nooks and crannies</strong>, allowing you to <strong>encounter the traceable past</strong>. It is a <strong>stroll</strong> covering the distance of 4 km, starting at the Church of Saint John of Jerusalem Outside the Walls and ending by the Church of the Sacred Heart of Lord Jesus and St. Florian. The route will allow you to <strong>experience the multiculturalism</strong> of Poznań, you will learn more about the royal and imperial character of the urban space, you&rsquo;ll recognize Poznań as an <strong>initiator of changes</strong>: accepting Christianity, adopting Reinessance thought, striving for national identity, priding itself of two uprisings &ndash; the Greater Poland Uprising of 1918-1919, the only victorious insurgence in the history of Poland, and 1956 Poznań Uprising. The <strong>originators</strong> of this <strong>tourist trail</strong> assumed that the <strong>sightseers will</strong> <strong>notice the urban structure</strong> and acknowledge the variety of residential areas. Following the route has yet another meaning - <em>kulturalne TRAKTowanie &ndash; </em> is all about pausing, taking part in artistic events, and recognizing the <strong>distinctineness of local traditions</strong>. You should definitely take the Royal-Imperial Route - in parts, or the complete trail, <strong>following your intuition</strong>, or a mobile app, independently, or <strong>with a guide</strong>, on foot, or on a bike.</p>

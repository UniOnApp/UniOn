<p>Are you under the impression that Poznań&rsquo;s <strong>downtown</strong> differs from the Old Town area? Do you notice the <strong>architectural distinctiveness</strong>, the diverseness of those <strong>urban concepts</strong>? The <strong>majestic edifices</strong> of the National Museum of Poznań, the Bazar, University Library, Collegium Maius, Collegium Minus, the former Collegium Chemicum, and the opera house were clearly built according to one <strong>aesthetic design</strong>. The district&rsquo;s <strong>architect</strong>, Joseph St&uuml;bben, modeled the area on Berlin and Vienna, and emphasized the German character of the urban plan. The district was created and developed during <strong>intensified Germanization</strong> of the Greater Poland region.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t miss out on the opportunity to take a closer look at the <strong>Art Noveau and Eclectic tenement houses &ndash; </strong>you can perceive unique details and embellishments.</p>
<p>The former Kaiser&rsquo;s Castle dominates the area. It&rsquo;s one of the youngest castles in Europe, the most recognizable city landmark. The edifice was built in Neo-Romanesque style, to serve as a residence of the Prussian emperor Wilhelm II, and later a would-be seat of Hitler.</p>
<p>On guided tours (especially at nights) you can take a peek into more than 600 rooms, explore the nooks and crannies of the castle, climb a 75-meter tower, admire the impressive Throne Hall (yes, Poznań has its throne!), relax in a rose garden and find a fountain with lions. The Castle was turned into a culture center, which mostly promotes <strong>visual arts</strong>. It is known as an <strong>educational institution</strong>. Events such as Poznań of the Poets, Ethno Port Festival, International Documentary Film Festival<em> OFF </em>CINEMA, and Festival of the <strong>Plot</strong> are celebrated in the Zamek Culture Center. Both the city inhabitants and tourists <strong>consider</strong> the Castle as a <strong>reference point</strong> in the urban landscape. </p>

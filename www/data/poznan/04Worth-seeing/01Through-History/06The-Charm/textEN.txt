<p>If you will be strolling around the Old Market Square, don&rsquo;t forget to stop by the <strong>Bamber woman</strong> &ndash; a statue and a well. It is located near the west wall of the Town Hall.</p>
<p>Designed as a public well, the Bamber woman <strong>commemorates</strong> the <strong>colonists from the region of Bamberg,</strong> who came to Poznań in the beginning of the 18th century and settled near Poznań, in the villages desolated due to war and diseases.</p>
<p>The <strong>well</strong> was founded in 1915 by the Goldenrings, a family known for wine-trade. The figure was made by a sculptor from Berlin, Joseph Wackerle, and modeled after Jadwiga Gadziemska, an employee in the founders&rsquo; company.</p>
<p>The statue depicts a woman wearing a traditional Bamber outfit, carrying yoke and water jugs used in wine making.</p>
<p>The well served people as well as animals, for instance horses, and featured drinking pots for dogs, too. </p>

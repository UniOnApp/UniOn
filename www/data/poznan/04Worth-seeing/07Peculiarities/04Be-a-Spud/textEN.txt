<p><strong>In Poznań dialect</strong> potato is called &ldquo;pyra&rdquo; [a spud].</p>
<p>The <strong>vegetable</strong> is well-known throughout the country, though it <strong>became</strong> particularly <strong>popular</strong> in Greater Poland (in regional dialect called Potatoland) and the region&rsquo;s <strong>capital</strong> Poznań (called the Potato city). Why Poznań?</p>
<p>In the 18th century, the lands of Greater Poland were <strong>colonized</strong> by German settlers, who <strong>cultivated</strong> potatoes. The Prussian authorities, especially king Frederick the Great, <strong>supported</strong> growing potatoes. Initially, potatoes <strong>were eaten by</strong> peasants and the common people who lived in the cities. Over time, they also <strong>entered the menus</strong> of nobility and middle class.</p>
<p>A spud has its own monument in Poznań. The monument, located in the central area of John Paul II park in Łęgi Dębińskie, was erected in September 2007. The monument is a 5 tone rock whose <strong>shape resembles</strong> a potato. An inscription reads: &ldquo;Poznań Spud&rdquo;. The monument was unveiled during the 5<sup>th</sup> edition of &ldquo;Potatoland Days Festival&rdquo;.</p>

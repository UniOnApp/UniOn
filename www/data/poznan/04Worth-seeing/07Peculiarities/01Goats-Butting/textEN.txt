<p>Why are the goats the <strong>symbol</strong> of Poznań?</p>
<p><strong>According to a legend</strong>, the goats are linked to the <strong>rebuilding</strong> of the <strong>Town Hall</strong>, which took place in 1551. The presentation of the refurbished building gathered crowds of city dwellers, <strong>the governor and his wife favored the event</strong> <strong>with their presence</strong>, too. On that occasion <strong>a feast was organized</strong> and a haunch was to be served as the <strong>main dish</strong>. Unfortunately, during the preparations, the haunch <strong>slipped down form the grate and fell into the fire</strong>. The search for a new piece of meat began. The chef Mikołaj sent his assistant to find some meat. Pietrek, the chef&rsquo;s assistant, went as far as outside the city walls where, on a meadow by the Warta river, he noticed two little white goats grazing. He took the goats to the Town Hall, but once they were <strong>freed</strong>, they <strong>run away</strong> to the Town Hall tower and <strong>jumped on the cornice</strong> above the clock. The crowds congregated by the Town Hall saw an unexpected sight &ndash; two little white goats playfully butting their heads. Amused by the situation, the governor condoned the stealing of animals and, <strong>to commemorate the event</strong>, he requested a mechanism with <strong>two effigies of butting goats</strong> to be added to the clock.</p>
<p>Since then, every day at 12.00 you can see two billy goats clashing their heads on the tower. Many years later the goats were commemorated with their own sculpture. The effigies of billy goats were placed near the main entrance to the Poznań City Hall, at Kolegiacki Square. It&rsquo;s a popular site visited by tourists who want to snap a picture while sitting on the goats&rsquo; back. </p>

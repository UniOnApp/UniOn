<p>The King&rsquo;s Castle &ndash; <strong>the former residence of king</strong> Przemysł II, <strong>the seat of viceroys</strong>, <strong>erected on a hill</strong> <strong>and incorporated in the system of city walls</strong>, <strong>emphasized the importance</strong> of Przemysł II, the duke of Greater Poland. Although <strong>once considered</strong> the oldest preserved residence of kings, the <strong>place where royal weddings and political meetings took place</strong>, the building <strong>fell into oblivion</strong> in the 18<sup>th</sup> century. However, you can still find the castle on the Przemysł Hill! This <strong>controversial reconstruction</strong> incites extreme opinions and emotions among Poznanians. The building, which is a variation on the Renaissance aesthetics, is <strong>ironically</strong> called the &ldquo;Gargamel&rsquo;s castle&rdquo;. Only the foundations of the city walls are the original remnants of the old castle. Some people account for the <strong>complicated and tragic history</strong> of the castle to the <strong>curse</strong> of Ludgard, the first wife of Przemysł II, whom he is believed to have murdered, because she couldn&rsquo;t bear him children. </p>
<p>The Museum of Applied Arts <strong>is</strong> now <strong>located</strong> in the castle, where, apart from seeing the traditional exhibits, you <strong>have a chance to try on historic outfits</strong>.</p>
<p>Besides, <strong>seeing Poznań from the observation deck at the tower </strong>of the King&rsquo;s Castle<strong> is a must</strong>! </p>

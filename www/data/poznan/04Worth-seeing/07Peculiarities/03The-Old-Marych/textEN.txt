<p>If you want to meet a <strong>true</strong> (though <strong>fictional</strong>) <strong>inhabitant of Poznań</strong>, stroll down to P&oacute;łwiejska street. There, <strong>at</strong> the northern <strong>end of the street</strong> <strong>you can</strong> always <strong>meet</strong> the Old Marych. The sculpture depicting this <strong>legendary protagonist</strong> was uncovered on March 21, 2001, <strong>on the first day of spring and the beginning of the cycling season</strong>.</p>
<p>The Old Marych symbolizes a <strong>native</strong> Poznanian and was created for the <strong>Poznań Polish Radio Station</strong> by Juliusz Kubel. The Old Marych&rsquo;s story was broadcasted on the radio and read by Marian Pogasz. The figure has his <strong>face</strong>. </p>
<p>The sculpture features Marych <strong>steering</strong> a bicycle towards the center of the city, a <strong>traditional Poznań bag</strong> hung across the handlebars. </p>
<p>In the high tourist season, Marych is the most photographed sculpture in Poznań ☺&nbsp;</p>

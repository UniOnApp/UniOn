<p>The New Zoo was opened in 1974, on the 100th anniversary of opening the Old <strong>Zoo</strong> at Zwierzyniecka street. It&rsquo;s the second biggest zoological garden in Poland. <strong>Located at the city&rsquo;s outskirts</strong>, <strong>on hilly grounds</strong> covered by forests, near the Malta Lake, with six vast ponds, the zoological garden <strong>is a natural habitat of</strong> domestic vegetation. Red deer, fallow deer, camels and llamas were the first inhabitants of the zoo. Nowadays the zoo is <strong>famous for one of the largest collection of birds of prey</strong> in Europe. Numerous species of animals housed in the New Zoo are <strong>engendered species</strong> such as the Visayan spotted deer, the Grevy&rsquo;s zebra, or the European bison.</p>

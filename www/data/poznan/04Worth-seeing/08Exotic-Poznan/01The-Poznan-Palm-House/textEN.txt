<p>In Thomas Wilson Park, in the former City Botanical Garden, you can find an impressive <strong>glass building</strong> &ndash; the over a hundred years-old Poznań Palm House. Here <strong>you can always count on the tropical climate, even if the weather conditions outside are poor and unpredictable</strong>. In the winter season it will awaken your <strong>memories of sunlight</strong>. Many species of <strong>exotic plants</strong> including water plants, tropical plants and succulents grow inside the Palm House. The <strong>unique collection</strong> includes 17 thousand plants. <strong>Imagine the blossoming</strong> in this scenery, the <strong>exoticism of smells</strong> and the almost substantial thick air. The greenhouse is a perfect place for an <strong>extraordinary date</strong>, can be the <strong>scenery for photo shoots</strong>, or in the summer, a space for a <strong>night spectacle of light</strong>. You should definitely check out the Night at the Palm House! The greenhouse hosts <strong>nature picnics</strong> (<em>In the Company of Nature</em>), and cat shows. In 1922 the Poznań Palm House was first to open a public <strong>aquarium</strong> in Poland. The <strong>thrill-seekers</strong> may enjoy the <strong>cyclic</strong> piranha feeding, displays of carnivorous plants, or <strong>descending to </strong>the nearby<strong> air-raid shelter</strong>. </p>
<p>Visit the caf&eacute; <em>7 Continents, </em>whose <strong>specialties</strong> <strong>include home-made cakes baked in accordance with the traditional recipes - </strong>cheesecake, apple pie and nut cake. </p>

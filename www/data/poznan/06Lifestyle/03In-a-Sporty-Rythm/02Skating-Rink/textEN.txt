<p>If you&rsquo;re a fan of winter sports such as ice skating, there are plenty of opportunities to boost your skills ☺</p>
<p>One of the venues where you can advance in skating is <em>Bogdanka</em>, the first artificial skating rink in Poznań. The name refers to a small rivulet Bogdanka, flowing nearby.</p>
<p>It opens close to the end of November, while in the spring and summer the place serves as a volleyball court.</p>
<p>Every Friday at 8.00 p.m. begins the <strong>Ice Party. </strong></p>
<p>Here you can rent and sharpen the skates.</p>
<p>The prices vary depending on the weekday and hour. </p>

<p>Poznań is considered to be a safe and nonviolent city, however, it doesn&rsquo;t mean that it is free of unsettling incidents. Although crime rates have fallen considerably and crime detection increases systematically, it is still risky to roam some parts of the city alone by night. Creepy stories are stereotypically pinned on Wilda, Łazarz, or Jeżyce districts, though these are repeated, unverified stories, derived from urban legends. The contemporary Jeżyce district is becoming more and more attractive, fashionable and friendly space, even at nighttime. Still, both the internet users&rsquo; opinions and police statistics show that you should avoid lone night strolls on<strong> Szamarzewskiego st.</strong>, especially near 24/7 liquor stores. Likewise, stay clear of <strong>Łazarski Market Square</strong>, <strong>Dworcowa st. and</strong> <strong>28 czerwca 1956 r</strong>. st. The closest vicinity of the Old Market and Garbary st. are constantly appearing on street-by-street crime maps. Gwarna st., near Collegium Maius, has achieved certain notoriety as well. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s common knowledge that the nights on weekends encourage risky behavior. Try to move around the city with a pack of friends, don&rsquo;t engage in altercations, don&rsquo;t get provoked. Stay away of underground passages, or dark side streets. If someone forces you to give them your wallet or phone, report that at a police station! Be vigilant! The city guards are always ready to help! The area under the city monitoring system is expanding, and the most popular venues and paths are patrolled by the police.</p>
<p>If you are not a fan of soccer, and you find a collective get back from a game appealing beware of trams packed with sports fans (singing out loud) going from the stadium at Bułgarska st., especially after a match between Lech and Warsaw&rsquo;s team Legia!</p>

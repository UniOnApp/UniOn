<p>For a number of years Pozna≈Ñ has been criticized to have <strong>turned its back on</strong> <strong>the</strong> Warta <strong>river</strong>. When <strong>water sports</strong> were considered, or water sports <strong>facilities</strong> were built, it had to be on the Malta Lake. Now the city <strong>looks to</strong> Warta again. <strong>In the summer season</strong> artificial <strong>beaches</strong> open along the stretch of the Warta river, where you can <strong>rent a deck chair, play beach volleyball, sunbathe, grill</strong>, and even <strong>swim</strong> in the hired <strong>water sports equipment: water bicycles, rowing boats, </strong>or<strong> kayaks</strong>. A new small <strong>river harbor</strong> was set up in the <strong>old riverbed</strong> near the Old Market. The city gains an entirely different perspective from the water!</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re not into paddling, you can go on a cruise in a small boat named <em>Karolinka</em>, moored nearby. </p>
<p>There are a few centers on the Warta river providing training courses for young people (<strong>canoeists</strong> and <strong>oarsmen</strong>). These sports have <strong>long tradition</strong> in our city, and the competitors triumphed many a time. </p>

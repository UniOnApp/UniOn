<p> <strong><em>Bula Park</em></strong> is an ideal place for enthusiasts of bowling games, where, in the vicinity of the Malta Lake, you can play <strong>bowling </strong>and <strong>boule</strong>, a less common game, which originated in France (also known as petanque). The place features 6 fully automated lanes for bowling with machines tracking the scores and screens presenting the results, as well as 5 lanes for boule, filled with special gravel, which facilitates the game. It&rsquo;s great entertainment both for those who have played it before and for amateurs. Although boule was introduced in Poland not until the first half of the 20<sup>th</sup> century, its popularity has been increasing ever since.</p>

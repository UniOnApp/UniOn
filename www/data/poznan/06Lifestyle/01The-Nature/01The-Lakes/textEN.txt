<p><strong>The Lake Rusałka </strong>is an artificial reservoir, supplied by the Bogdanka rivulet. The pier at the lake is photographed quite often &ndash; from this perspective you can observe the vastness of the lake and its variegated shoreline. Still, Rusałka is more than just a guarded bathing beach, a perfect place for a picnic, a bike route, or a walking path. Other events such as cross-country running, cross-country skiing in winter, or New Year&rsquo;s meeting of cyclists happen around Rusałka as well. <em>Rusałka </em>is also the name of a restaurant, whose meaningful subheading says <strong><em>Sama frajda </em>i.e. Pure joy</strong>. There you can expect culinary joy after a long stroll or a bicycle trip. The &ldquo;Plażojada&rdquo; picnic area project seems quite promising. <em>Piach Bar </em>and <em>Grillowisko</em> have their habitu&eacute;s, too. Although the lake&rsquo;s name refers to the mythical water nymph, under its waters lies the dramatic past: fans of history can look up the history of Festung Posen and the tragic fate of Poznań Jews.</p>
<p>At the north-western edge of the city lies the Strzeszyńskie Lake, which is considered to be one of the cleanest in the region. Surrounded by forests, the lake draws to its shores the enthusiasts of sunbathing (guarded bathing beach), anglers, cyclists and fans of strolling. It is also the place of outdoor cultural events, mainly concerts. Thanks to Leszek Możdżer, a composer and jazz musician who founded the <strong>Enter Enea Music Festival</strong>, jazz music reverberates on the lake on warm June evenings. MPK company, responsible for the transport service during the event, promises that all jazz lovers, even the those giving the longest ovations, will return to the city center once the concerts finish. The lake surroundings and night scenery lend unique impressions. The Strzeszyńskie Lake is also an outdoor park of contemporary sculpture. <em>ABC Gallery</em> operates on the lake and on its initiative Visual Park was created. Here you will find contemporary art of spatial forms, vaguely-shaped, composed in the green space. Here meet the theoreticians of art within the framework of the Artists and Theoreticians Symposium Summer Jam.

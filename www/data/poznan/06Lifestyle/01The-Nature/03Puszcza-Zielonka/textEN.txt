<p>You should definitely visit Zielonka Forest <strong>Landscape Park</strong>. It is the largest <strong>forest area</strong> near Poznań, abounding with picturesque landscapes, encouraging to undertake outdoor leisure activities. If you seek relaxation, try the walking path &ndash; you can choose between the philosophical, monastic, mid-forest, or holiday track (mapped out by the forest expert, Bogdan Kucharski). If you are a two-wheeler enthusiast and own a bike, take on the challenge of the Large (circa 50 km), or the Small <strong>Bicycle Ring</strong> (circa 35 km). Or, perhaps you prefer the Cistercian Bicycle Trail, a 140-km-long track from Poznań to Dąbr&oacute;wka Kościelna? You can find more about bicycle paths around Poznań at:</p>

<p>The bicycle path from Murowana Goślina to Czerwonak, proposed by Wojciech Gogolewski, will surely do the trick for <strong>thrill-seekers</strong>. The path, which is called <em>extreme</em>, includes cycling through sand and mud sections, steep land slopes and abrupt downhill sectors (no wonder one of them is described as a <em>killer</em>). It&rsquo;s almost trekking-like! Reach the Dziewicza G&oacute;ra [the Virgin Mountain] and find out the story behind its name.</p>
<p>Would you rather see the Zielonka Forest from the perspective of lakes? The <strong>canoeing rally</strong> is 11-km-long, on the way are two camping sites at your disposal. The <strong>presence of beavers</strong> attests to the area&rsquo;s cleanness and unpolluted environment. </p>
<p>Thanks to the protected area &ldquo;Natura 2000&rdquo;, set up to protect the forest ecosystems, unique plants, whose designations speak for themselves, can be observed in the Zielonka Forest: February daphne, Turk&rsquo;s cap lilly, or the broad-leaved helleborine.</p>
<p>Prefer to observe the wildlife? Seek for the exceptional butterflies - the unbelievable number of over 500 species have been observed. Scrupulous nature explorers may notice erne&rsquo;s or black stork&rsquo;s nests. Watch out for the bats! While admiring the nature, don&rsquo;t miss out the beauty of the wooden churches, and remember the mysterious border pole (which could be a piece depicting the pagan deity &ndash; Świętowit).

<p>The expedition <strong><em>Puszcza wpuszcza</em></strong> could be an ad catch-phrase! Isn&rsquo;t it a great pronunciation exercise? </p>

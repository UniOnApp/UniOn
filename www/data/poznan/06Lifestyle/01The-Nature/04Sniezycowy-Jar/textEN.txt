<p>At the end of the winter season you can witness a fascinating phenomenon called <em>the spectacle of Nature</em>, a harbinger of spring. In the Śnieżycowy Jar Nature Reserve (Spring Snowflake Nature Reserve encourages you to set on a trip) usually in March, the snowflake, a plant rarely growing in lowland areas, blossoms almost unnoticeably. The abrupt and brief blossoming calls for exceptional alertness. You can&rsquo;t miss that sight! Keep checking the website of Łopuch&oacute;wko forest inspectorate (<a href="http://www.lopuchowko.poznan.lasy.gov.pl/">http://www.lopuchowko.poznan.lasy.gov.pl/</a>) &ndash; you&rsquo;ll find out when it&rsquo;s the best time to visit the reserve and see the peak of blossoming, which will render you speechless. Be sure to keep the image of the carpets woven of these delicate plants in mind! Take pictures! The winter, lack of light, and the longing for the spring are replaced by an explosion of whiteness, the fragile beauty, which lasts for three weeks only! </p>

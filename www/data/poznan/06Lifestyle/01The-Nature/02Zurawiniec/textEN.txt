<p>A <strong>peat moor</strong> within the city grounds? But of course, on the outskirts of Piątkowo district, in a postglacial channel, in a ground depression, spreads the Żurawiniec Nature Reserve. It&rsquo;s a place where you can <strong>reconstruct the past</strong> <strong>geological processes</strong>. The particular <strong>microclimate</strong> of the area prompted the city authorities to consider the idea of setting up a <strong>geopark</strong>.</p>
<p>The park&rsquo;s vegetation, among others bog cranberry, marsh cinquefoil, bog stitchwort, and bogbean, will surely pique the interest of <strong>biology enthusiasts</strong>. </p>
<p>There are excellent run training routes in Żurawiniec, but one should bear in mind that this is a <strong>bog</strong>-like area, damp and teeming in mosquitos. Be sure to use a repellent and be open-eyed! If you&rsquo;ll be here at first dawn, you might come across a deer.</p>
<p><strong>Reserve areas</strong> prevent the <strong>loss of endangered species</strong>, they allow to keep the <strong>geological value </strong>of a place, they require the respect for nature. Remember, these areas are protected by law.</p>

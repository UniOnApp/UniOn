<p>The Wielkopolski Square, one of the oldest squares in Poznań known since the Middle Ages, situated in the city center, in close proximity to the Old Market Square, was located in the former suburbs called Glinki. Once the square <strong>looked</strong> quite <strong>differently</strong>: there were <strong>brickyards</strong>, a <strong>watermill</strong> powered by the Bogdanka rivulet, and a small <strong>pond</strong>, which, for a short time, <strong>served</strong> the city inhabitants <strong>as</strong> a <strong>lido</strong>. Nowadays <strong>there remain no traces of</strong> the old edifices, while the rivulet flows in the tunnels under the city. Before the war, the square was surrounded by beautiful historical tenement houses, but sadly only two <strong>escaped destruction</strong> &ndash; the large tenement house no. 28 form the beginning of the 20th century, and the Prussian edifice of the National Archive. The buildings you can see now were built in accordance with the <strong>socialist realism canon</strong> from the 1950s that the Poznań architects followed. The new buildings were to refer to the pre-war tenement houses and, as Poznanians say, the effect was achieved, though the <strong>dwellers complain</strong> about the narrow and <strong>impractical interiors</strong>. <strong>Fun fact</strong>: one of the first caf&eacute;s in Poznań was opened in 1786 by Jan Geisler at the Wielkopolski Square</p>
<p>Currently the Wielkopolski Square is home to one of the biggest open-air <strong>food market</strong> in Poznań, which is symbolic, because of the so-called famine riots in Poznań, which erupted in 1847, when the prices of food sky-rocketed so high, that many inhabitants starved and the streets were overwhelmed with <strong>beggars</strong>. This led to the clashes between the police and the famished city dwellers.&nbsp;</p>

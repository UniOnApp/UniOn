<p>Today the Jeżycki Market Square <strong>is famous</strong> chiefly <strong>for</strong> the biggest and most popular <strong>open-air</strong> <strong>marketplace</strong>, located on a big square in the heart of the Jeżyce district. It is situated on the Jana Henryka Dąbrowskiego street, the longest street in Poznań (8,5-kilometer-long), once called the Berlin Route, because from here people set off to the capital of Germany. Back then the journey took 26 hours, today the trip takes only 3. Picturesque tenement houses designed by the most eminent pre-war Poznań architects surround the market square.</p>
<p>At the many <strong>stands</strong> you will find fresh vegetables and fruits, garments, highlanders&rsquo; goods, sweets and other products. You can be astonished at some of them, for example products imported from Germany, once considered luxurious goods. However, the Jeżycki Market Square is mostly recognized for the flower stands (i.e. <strong>florists</strong>) &ndash; there are several spots, some open <strong>round-the-clock</strong>. Poles <strong>adore</strong> flowers and any occasion to give them is good: <strong>birthdays, name days, thanks, congratulations, apologies, or declarations of love</strong>. The experienced florists will help you match a bouquet right for the occasion, remember though never to buy chrysanthema &ndash; in Poland these flowers are reserved for <strong>funeral services</strong>.</p>
<p>It is also worthwhile to get further away from the Jeżycki Market Square to 5 Roosevelt street, where the Posnanian family Borejko lived &ndash; characters well-known from the hit novels by Małgorzata Musierowicz, a Poznanian writer of children stories. Almost all children and teenagers in Poland know the stories about the Borejko family, and the tenement house they lived in.</p>
<p>The Jeżycki Market Square also <strong>witnessed darker events</strong> in the Polish history. During the June 1956 <strong>protests</strong>, a body of a 13-year-old boy was found in the vicinity of the market square, murdered by a gunshot to the back. The street vis-&agrave;-vis the Rialto cinema was named Romka Strzałkowskiego street, in honor of the murdered boy.</p>

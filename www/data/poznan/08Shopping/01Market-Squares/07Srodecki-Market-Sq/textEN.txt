<p>The Śr&oacute;decki Square is a unique <strong>phenomenon</strong> in Poznań. Until recently forgotten by all, now relives its<strong> Renaissance</strong>, which, according to many Poznanians, <strong>owes it to&hellip;</strong> a <strong>mural</strong>. In reality it&rsquo;s just a fragment of the former Śr&oacute;decki Square. What&rsquo;s interesting is that the former square was bigger than the central Old Market Square, and had its own town hall till 1960s! Unfortunately, the market square was heavily <strong>damaged</strong> during the war, the town hall was <strong>demolished</strong>, and the large area was earmarked for two-lane road construction. Since then, the square <strong>has</strong> <strong>fallen into oblivion</strong>. In 2015 it caught the attention again when on one of the walls of a tenement house a 3D <strong>mural</strong> titled <em>Opowieść śr&oacute;decka z trębaczem na dachu i kotem w tle</em> <strong>was uncovered</strong>. The <strong>painting</strong> <strong>inspired by a photograph</strong> from the 1920s <strong>got a lot of publicity</strong> in the European mass media. Nowadays at the tiny square (with the Poznań&rsquo;s shortest street, the 50-meter-long St. Jacek street) there is no marketplace with stalls, but on every street you can find enchanting restaurants, bars and cafes <strong>serving</strong> cuisines from around the world! </p>
<p>It all blends in <strong>harmony</strong> with the nearby 18th-century <strong>cloister</strong> and the 17th-century St. Margaret <strong>Church</strong>. One might say that the mural <strong>broke the spell on the Śr&oacute;dka district</strong>, and <strong>brings it back to its former prominence</strong>. Those who miss the previous square can, however, go to Porta Posnania to see the regularly organized exhibitions concerning the market square and the Śr&oacute;dka district. These are peculiar <strong>time travels</strong>: you can see the usually <strong>inaccessible</strong> monuments, see an exhibition of old photographs, try the local <strong>specialities</strong> of old cuisine (for example <strong>beer soup</strong>), take a stroll with a guide on the streets of Śr&oacute;dka, and listen to the stories told by the older inhabitants describing how life looked like in back in the old days.</p>
<p>A reconstruction of the non-existent market square is in prospect, but it will surely be a difficult venture that will take many years to finish. </p>

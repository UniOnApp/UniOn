<p>The Bernardyński Square, located <strong>near</strong> the Old Market Square, is <strong>quite a large marketplace</strong>, <strong>well-known</strong> mainly for selling <strong>organic food</strong>. <strong>Straw </strong>and<strong> hay</strong> for <strong>horses</strong> were sold there before the war, but with the coming of <strong>motorization</strong>, the city authorities decided to move the fruit and vegetable market from the Old Market Square right to the Bernardyński Square. The place took its name from the Bernardine Brothers, who came to Poznań at Christmas time in 1456, and who first erected a <strong>wooden</strong> chapel, which was soon replaced by a <strong>brick</strong> church. The <strong>temple</strong>, which was many a time reconstructed after war damage and natural catastrophies (<strong>fires, hurricanes</strong>), currently <strong>proudly presents itself</strong> on the Bernardyński Square. Although the Bernardine Brothers are gone, the monastery buildings are occupied by the Franciscans. You can&rsquo;t miss out on the mechanical nativity play at Christmas. In the vicinity of the square is the <strong>prestigious</strong> historical St. Mary Magdalene High School (called &ldquo;Marynka&rdquo;), and two hospitals. The closeness of the Old Market Square makes the Bernardyński Square the best landmark to start the sightseeing tour of the most important Poznań market square. </p>

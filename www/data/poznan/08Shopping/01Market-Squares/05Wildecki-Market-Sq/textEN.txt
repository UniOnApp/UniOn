<p>Wildecki Market Square is one of the prettiest, <strong>restored</strong> city market squares. Owing to the historic <strong>neo-Renaissance housing</strong> surrounding the place, the Wildecki Market Square is one of the most <strong>presentable</strong> landmarks in Poznań, despite its location in the heart of Wilda, a working-class district. The nearby vast <strong>production plants</strong>, whose heydays fell on the socialist period (Hipolit Cegielski Factory HCP and Rail Rolling Stock Repair Workshops) <strong>determined the industrial character</strong> of this city area. An <strong>interesting story</strong> is related to this market square. Once a windmill was standing in the square&rsquo;s center, but was torn down to create place for a marketplace. With time, tenement houses, schools, churches, a <strong>historic city bath</strong>, and <strong>an old people&rsquo;s home</strong> (currently the seat of the Poznań University of Technology) were built around the square. At the renovated marketplace you can buy mainly fresh fruits and vegetables. </p>

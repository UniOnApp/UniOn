<p>The Łazarski Market Square, created at the end of the 19th century, which was designed as a a <strong>city garden</strong> and a <strong>playground</strong>, currently serves chiefly as a marketplace. The site was included in the <strong>registry of historical monuments</strong>, because of the numerous preserved pre-war tenement houses surrounding the square. It is located on one of the longest streets in Poznań, Głogowska street. The street diverging from the marketplace also bears the name <em>Rynek Łazarski</em>.</p>
<p>In the 1920s and 1930s the Łazarski Market Square was a vibrant and <strong>thriving trade</strong> spot. More than 30 bars and restaurants were open, and up to the 1960s you could see <strong>horse-drawn carts</strong> the merchants used to get to Poznań. Currently the place is somehow <strong>forgotten</strong>, awaiting <strong>modernization</strong> which is to start in 2018. The marketplace size will be reduced to make place for cafes and leisure facilities. The place is worth visiting even before the revitalization, <strong>go back in time and feel the vibes</strong> of the century-old squares. Naturally, here you can purchase fruits, vegetables, sweets and flowers. In addition, there is a <strong>flea market</strong> distinguishing this market square from other markets in Poznań, with stalls offering <strong>antiquities </strong>and <strong>old stuff</strong>. </p>

<p>Why is the <strong>center </strong>of Poznań (like many other Polish cities) <strong>called</strong> <strong>the Old Market Square</strong>? What does the word <em>rynek </em>mean? Is there only one market in the city?</p>
<p>Today the word <em>rynek </em>[market square] has many meanings, and comes from the German word <em>Ring</em> denoting <strong>a ring</strong>. The majorities of Polish cities were set up according to a system based on German town law, which stated that a town square should be established in the heart of the city with a town hall at its center (the seat of city authorities) and a <strong>mercantile building</strong>. In fact, such layout <strong>resembles </strong>a ring. Nowadays, the word <em>rynek </em>also signifies any marketplace. If Poles say <em>idę na zakupy na rynek</em>, they mean they are going to an outdoor market, where they can buy fresh vegetables and fruits from fruit and vegetable stands. There are a few such places in Poznań. Get to know them all!</p>
<p> Did you know that apart from the Old Market Square there are four other market squares in Poznań? They <strong>are located</strong> in four different <strong>districts in Poznań</strong>, which, up to the beginning of the 20th century, were <strong>separate municipalities</strong>, and thus had their own market squares and municipal buildings. After their incorporation within the city limits, they became little marketplaces, where you can buy local <strong>products</strong> from Greater Poland rural areas. In comparison to other Polish cities, these places <strong>make</strong> Poznań a unique city, due to the fact that they represent the best urban concepts in Poland from the turn of the 19th and 20th centuries. Some of them are beautiful and thrive, others neglected and forlorn, there are some that lost their original character. But still, we encourage you to visit them all! </p>

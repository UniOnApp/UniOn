<p>It is the least known and the most <strong>forgotten</strong> city market square of all, though established nearly 100 years ago. Before the war it was <strong>surrounded</strong> with beautiful tenement houses, which sadly <strong>didn&rsquo;t withstand</strong> and had never been rebuilt. Ever since after the war the place <strong>has been derelict</strong>. There were many <strong>reconstruction drafts</strong> and <strong>spatial layout plans</strong>, but none of them were implemented. One of the more interesting sites is the renovated <strong>fire watchtower</strong> from the year 1900, the former seat of Pozna≈Ñ&rsquo;s <strong>volunteer firefighters</strong>. Back in the old days it was an <strong>informal symbol</strong> of the square, and at present it&rsquo;s still the most characteristic edifice in this part of the city, although firefighters don&rsquo;t work there any more. Now the building houses&hellip; a <strong>wholesale warehouse</strong>.</p>
<p>Regretfully, the lack of urban planning resulted in the market square&rsquo;s <strong>deterioration</strong> and, by far, there are no plans to <strong>restore</strong> its former <strong>splendor</strong>. <strong>Paradoxically</strong>, the Eastern Market Square kept its provincial vibe thanks to its negligence. </p>

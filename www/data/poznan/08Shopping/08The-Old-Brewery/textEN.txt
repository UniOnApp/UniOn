<p>The large characteristic red-brick edifice of the Old Brewery Shopping, Arts and Business Center, with the shiny metal structure elements has become an inherent part of the cultural and commercial cityscape, despite being just opened in 2003. The Center was created on the initiative of Grażyna Kulczyk in the forlorn since the 1980s buildings of the old brewery, founded in the middle of the 19<sup>th</sup> century by Ambrosius Hugger.</p>
<p>Nowadays the Old Brewery houses numerous shops (both chain and designers&rsquo; stores), customer service points, and restaurants. What&rsquo;s interesting is that shopping or friends&rsquo; meetings imperceptibly turn into a voyage to the world of art &ndash; in the mall&rsquo;s interiors you can find contemporary art exhibitions (inter alia by Choe U&rsquo;Rama, Igor Mitoraj, Alessandro Mendini). The building itself catches the eye, too. The new wing&rsquo;s fa&ccedil;ade relief is a collaborative achievement of ADS Studio and Adam Garnek. The project&rsquo;s design won the recognition of experts and city inhabitants (it was hailed as one of the 20 icons of Polish architecture after 1989, and was given the Jan Baptysta Quadro Award for the best building built in Poznań in 2003). The Center also organizes time exhibitions, concerts, movie screenings, etc. The space is used according to Grażyna Kulczyk&rsquo;s concept &ldquo;50 50 Idea&rdquo;, assuming that 50 % of the undertaking is devoted to art, while the rest to its commercial function. Upon prior appointment you can visit the Old Brewery with a guide. If, however, you want to be up-to-date with the upcoming events and offers organized in the Center, install the Old Brewery app. The Old Brewery has been awarded the prestigious awards for the <strong>Best Shopping Center in Europe</strong> (2008) and the <strong>Best Shopping Center in the World</strong> (2005).</p>

<p><em>Sale, solde, saldo, </em><strong><em>posezonowa wyprzedaż</em></strong><em>, </em><strong><em>obniżka,</em></strong> <strong><em>przecena</em></strong><em>, rasprodaża, </em><em>Ausverkauf</em> &ndash; don&rsquo;t we all love these words! In all languages these are words with <strong>nice ring to them</strong>, especially if you&rsquo;re a student and your <strong>resources </strong>are<strong> limited</strong> &ndash; the scholarship isn&rsquo;t high, you have <strong>to pay</strong> for your accommodation, food, and tickets to home&hellip; Sales are <strong>great opportunities</strong> to buy something <strong>new, fashionable </strong>and<strong> inexpensive</strong>. It&rsquo;s good to be in the know when the season sales start.</p>
<p>The <strong>first wave</strong> <strong>of</strong> autumn-winter collections <strong>sales</strong> starts in <strong>December</strong>, right <strong>after Christmas</strong> (sometimes even a few weeks before, but being busy with Christmas preparations we don&rsquo;t notice them) and continues in <strong>January</strong>, when the cut-price goods are even 70% off. In <strong>February</strong> the spring collection hits the shops and the remaining autumn collections are sold <strong>at the cheapest prices</strong>. However, if you wait for the highest discounts, the right <strong>size</strong> or model could have been sold out and you may be left empty-handed.</p>
<p><strong>March, April and May </strong>are the<strong> mid-season sale </strong>months. Garments are usually 30% off.</p>
<p>You can buy summer collections at discounted prices from June, but the best time to get the ideal dress is July/August, when the discounts reach 70-90%. Have a good shopping!</p>

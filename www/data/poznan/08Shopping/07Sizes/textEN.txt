<p>Wondering how to shop for clothes not knowing the Polish size charts?</p>
<p>According to the <strong>British </strong>custom<strong>,</strong> garment measurements are given in inches, while in Poland metric size charts are used. Our size 36 is the British size 8, Polish 38 is English size 10, 40 is the equivalent of 12, etc. </p>
<p>If you want to buy clothes made in <strong>France</strong>, remember that the garments manufactured in France differ in one size (Polish size 40 corresponds to French 42), while if you are interested in Italian apparel, the difference covers 3 sizes (our size 36 is Italian 42).</p>
<p>In case of the<strong> German size system</strong>, it&rsquo;s higher than the Polish one i.e. German size 36 corresponds to Polish 38, and so on. </p>
<p>If you shop online, best check out and apply to the manufacturer&rsquo;s size guide.</p>

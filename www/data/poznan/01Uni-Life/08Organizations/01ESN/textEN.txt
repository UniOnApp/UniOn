<p><strong>ESN &ndash; Erasmus Student Network</strong></p>
<p> <em>I&rsquo;m an ESN-er! What is your superpower?</em> &ndash; is the slogan promoting Erasmus Student Network, the organization supporting mobility students during their stay in Poznań, which can assign you a mentor (local buddy), a person who will take care of you in the new surroundings, a chaperon. The very first experience of a stay at a partner university resembles a discoverer&rsquo;s exploration &ndash; if you need advice, explanation or inspiration, contact AMU&rsquo;s ESN before your mobility starts (<a href="http://uam.esn.pl/en">http://uam.esn.pl/en</a>). Esn-er will greet you at an airport/ railway station, direct you to the right hall of residence, help you with accommodation procedures, show you around the university facilities, accompany you to the inaugural meeting. Together you will visit AMU International Office and the Faculty Erasmus+ Program coordinator. Your buddy will share priceless hints with you on how to organize your student life, take advantage of the city facilities and take in the cultural specificity of Poznań. By working in a tandem you can teach your mother tongue and be taught Polish, you can participate in many social initiatives for education, handicapped or excluded people, you can promote the idea of a community composed of a variety of cultures, worldviews and attitudes. ESN can also take you on a trip around Poland or abroad (Discover Poland, Discover Europe), organize get-togethers, give culinary inspirations (Euroinners), offer sports competitions (ESNOlimpics). Accept our help and come on board!</p>

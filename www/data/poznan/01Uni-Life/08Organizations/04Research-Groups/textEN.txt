<p><strong>Student research groups &ndash; </strong>gather students eager to broaden their knowledge and develop their skills beyond the study programs and curricula. The groups organize meetings devoted to debates on particular scientific issues, discussions about books, as well as meetings with distinguished people from the scientific and artistic circles, excursions and a few days&rsquo; science field trips. Some student research groups exist only at one faculty, while others gather students of different faculties, who share the same passion. Often student research groups are divided into sections, specializing in a given branch of knowledge. Each group has its own scientific supervisor (university staff member), but his work is directed by the representation of elected students.&nbsp;</p>

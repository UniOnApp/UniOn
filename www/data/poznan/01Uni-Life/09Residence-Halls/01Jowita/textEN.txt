<p><strong>Dorm</strong> &ndash; popular name of a dormitory or residence hall, which belongs to the university. The dormitories are not only convenient places to stay (usually situated in the close vicinity of the university facilities where the classes are held), but also important centers of students&rsquo; social life. Many parties and events, open for guests or private, are held in the dorms. There are mostly double rooms or rooms shared between more than two people.

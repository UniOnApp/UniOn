<p>The highest authority at every university is the <strong>rector</strong>, most often an elected university professor. The head of the university is customarily addressed to as <strong>His/Her Magnificence</strong>. The rector&rsquo;s <strong>representative outfit is a red or purple coat (gown)</strong>, often <strong>a scepter</strong> and <strong>a decorative chain</strong> with the symbol of the governed institution. Rector&rsquo;s term of office at state universities lasts 4 years. Apart from the rector, the university is governed by <strong>vice-rectors</strong>, who perform administrative and representative functions. They are <strong>the rector&rsquo;s deputies</strong>.</p>
<p>Faculties are headed by <strong>deans</strong>, while institutes are headed by <strong>directors</strong>. </p>
<p><strong>Faculties</strong></p>
<p>Basic organizational units in academic institutions. They gather lecturers, researchers and students of <strong>a particular scientific discipline</strong> (for example the Faculty of English), or a group of related scientific disciplines (for instance the Faculty of Educational Studies). Each Faculty has its&rsquo; own seat and a library, sometimes the Faculties have their own campuses. AMU comprises 15 Faculties. Faculties are composed of smaller units: <strong>Institutes and Chairs</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Collegium Minus</strong></p>
<p>Neo-Renaissance building, situated in the former Castle District on the west side of Adam Mickiewicz Square, built for the Prussian Royal Academy. At present it is <strong>the main seat of the University</strong>, housing the Rector&rsquo;s offices and University administration. Among others, here you will find AMU International Office and Erasmus+ Program Office, where you will soon come by <strong>to obtain some information, advice and support</strong>. The building <strong>also hosts the inaugurations of academic years, ceremonies of completion of studies</strong>, important conference meetings. <strong>The University Grand Hall</strong> is known for its perfect acoustics and paintings depicting Apollo&rsquo;s chariot surrounded by the Muses. If you want to experience <strong>the academic spirit</strong>, join the AMU parade &ndash; take a stroll from Collegium Minus to Collegium Maius alongside the Rector and the governing bodies of the Faculty of Polish and Classical Philology. You can also experience the historical character of the place in a different way &ndash; sit on a bench in front of Collegium Minus <strong>beside the sculpture of Heliodor Święcicki</strong>, the first Rector of the University.

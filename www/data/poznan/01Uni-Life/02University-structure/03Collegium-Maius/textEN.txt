<p><strong>Collegium Maius</strong></p>
<p>One of the most representative historical edifices of the Royal-Imperial Route in Poznań, situated in the close vicinity of the Kaiser&rsquo;s Castle, Collegium Minus and the Grand Theatre. Built at the beginning of the 20<sup>th</sup> c. in <strong>Neo-Baroque style</strong>, Collegium Maius was originally the seat of the Prussian Colonization Committee, an institution responsible for Germanization policy. In the 1920s the edifice was transferred to the University and has been serving as a University building ever since. Nowadays it is the seat of the Faculty of Polish and Classical Philology and rector&rsquo;s offices of the Medical University in Poznań. It is the place where you will participate in Polish language courses for foreign students. <strong>The wall paintings, unique hall and interior galleries, Mickiewicz&rsquo;s Hall, modern theatre scene and a library building with its fa&ccedil;ade made of sandstone and glass</strong> (best architecture project in 2010) are especially worth seeing. The sight of Collegium Maius at night is unforgettable!</p>

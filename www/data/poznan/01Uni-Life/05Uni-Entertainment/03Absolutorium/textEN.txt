<p>Students who end their education obtain <strong>the certificate of completion of studies</strong> (from Latin <strong><em>absolutorium</em></strong>) at a formal ceremony attended by the rector and the faculty governing bodies. The diplomas are distributed by the dean of the faculty at <strong>a formal ceremony</strong>, which is held <strong>at the end of every academic year in the University&rsquo;s Grand Hall</strong>. Students wear <strong>traditional academic outfits for the event: black academic dresses and graduate caps with color tassels</strong> (each faculty has been assigned a different color). The event is also <strong>attended by the students&rsquo; invited guests: their friends and families</strong>. Once the ceremony is over, the students receive flowers from their relatives and take <strong>memorial photos</strong> in the traditional academic dresses in front of Collegium Minus. The final examinations for a given degree can be taken on condition that a student received the certificate of completion of studies.</p>

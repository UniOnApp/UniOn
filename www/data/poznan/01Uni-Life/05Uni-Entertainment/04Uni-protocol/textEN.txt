<p><strong>Forms of address at the University</strong></p>
<p>Students at the university <strong>are expected to observe the university protocol</strong>, comply with the personal code of conduct and a few other rules. In Poland, <strong>while addressing the academic staff, the students should use their official titles &ldquo;Panie profesorze/Pani profesor&rdquo;, &ldquo;Panie doktorze/ Pani doktor&rdquo;, &ldquo;</strong><strong>Panie magistrze/Pani magister</strong><strong>&rdquo;</strong>. It&rsquo;s important to remember to use these forms of address in the e-mail correspondence as well. Only the letters to the rector should be addressed &ldquo;His Magnificence the Rector<strong>&hellip;&rdquo; The university teachers address students using the forms Ms./Mr.</strong> (+surname or +first name). The title &ldquo;<em>magister</em>&rdquo; (M.A.) isn&rsquo;t in fact an official title and many lecturers prefer not to be addressed that way in daily communication. Instead, the form &ldquo;Ms./Mr.&rdquo; will suffice. </p>
<p>It is worth mentioning that in Poland there is a tradition of an &ldquo;<strong>academic quarter</strong>&rdquo;, which means that a 15 minutes&rsquo; delay is acceptable for students. Students who are late more than 15 minutes should not enter an auditory.</p>
<p>Every teaching staff member has individual duty hours for students who would like to come and discuss the topics presented in class.</p>

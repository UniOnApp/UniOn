<p><strong>Academic routines</strong></p>
<p>Every academic year has a similar structure. It begins with <strong>the Freshman&rsquo;s Day and a formal inauguration of the academic year</strong> in the presence of <strong>the university authorities</strong>. Matriculation ceremony is also a part of the event - representatives of students commencing their studies <strong>are admitted to the university and give their oaths</strong>, while <strong>the academic community sings the Latin hymn <em>Gaudeamus igitur</em></strong><em>.</em> The celebrations are accompanied by an <strong>inaugural lecture</strong> and <strong>musical setting</strong>. Also, <strong>the most outstanding university awards and decorations are given to the leading university staff</strong>. No classes are held during the inauguration. Apart from the general university inauguration, each faculty holds its own opening of the new academic year. </p>

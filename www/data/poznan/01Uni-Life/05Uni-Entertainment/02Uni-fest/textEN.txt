Students of all higher education institutions in Pozna≈Ñ take part in those celebrations. Similar festivities are observed in other academic cities in Poland. The first student rag was celebrated in Cracow in the 15th c. Nowadays, it is an annual event held at the end of every academic year in many cities endowed with higher education institutions. </p>

<p><strong>Class timetables</strong> for each semester <strong>are announced online</strong> <strong>at a given Faculty website</strong>. You won&rsquo;t be assigned to a particular group of students. You will have to choose courses at the Faculty <strong>yourself</strong>, according to your needs, the necessity to study a subject equivalent to the one you would have at your alma mater, or convenient schedule. <strong>You should register for the chosen course in USOS</strong> (online administrative system). Should that occur too difficult, please contact the Faculty Erasmus+ coordinator, who will surely help you.</p>
<p><strong>Absences</strong></p>
<p><strong>The attendance policy</strong> may be different from one course to the other, as they are set by the instructors and passed to students at the first meeting. Usually a student needs <strong>a written excuse for his/her absence, for instance a doctor&rsquo;s excuse, or a letter from the field trip organizer</strong>. When a student exceeded the limit of absences, he/she may have to meet the teacher during his office hours to prove they caught up the missed classes.</p>

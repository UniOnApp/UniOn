<p><strong>Instructors&rsquo; office hours</strong></p>
<p>University instructors offer special office hours to give counsel and supplementary help regarding the matters discussed in class. Every teacher sets their individual office hours and informs the students about them at their first session. Usually the office hours are held twice a week, at the same time throughout the semester, in the teacher&rsquo;s office. The information is on the teacher&rsquo;s office doorplate and in the office. In case of some unexpected and exclusive circumstances, or at the request of a student, the teacher may also set additional office hours. It is a time to discuss the final essays, make up for the lost classes, resolve any doubts which arose in class, or ask for supplementary reading list. </p>

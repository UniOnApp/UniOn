<p>Every university lecturer sets /adapts the forms of course completion and assessment criteria. Most commonly the students are given grades ranging from A/5 (very good) to F/2 (fail). </p>
<p><strong>A/5</strong><strong> EXCELLENT - outstanding performance<br /> </strong><strong>B/4+</strong><strong> VERY GOOD - above the average standard with only minor errors<br /> </strong><strong>C/4</strong><strong> GOOD - generally sound work with some minor errors<br /> </strong><strong>D/3+</strong><strong> SATISFACTORY - fair but with a number of notable errors<br /> </strong><strong>E/3</strong><strong> SUFFICIENT - fair but with significant shortcomings<br /> </strong><strong>F/2</strong><strong> FAIL</strong></p>
<p>Students are registered in <strong>the University Study-Oriented System (USOS)</strong>, which is an electronic version of a traditional credit book. The lecturers assign the grades from particular courses in the USOS. </p>
<p><strong>The European Credit Transfer and Accumulation System (ECTS)</strong> has been adopted at all Polish universities. It is a system for assessing a student&rsquo;s progress, for confirming and passing the subsequent stages of education. </p>
<p>Some subjects end with exams, while others with graded credit. Also, mid-term tests are held during the academic year to check what the students learned in class.</p>

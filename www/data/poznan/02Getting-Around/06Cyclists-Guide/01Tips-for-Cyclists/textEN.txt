<p><strong>Poznań is becoming more and more bicycle-friendly city</strong>. The inhabitants <strong>appreciate the freedom of driving through a congested city</strong>, <strong>the local authorities attend to the proper traffic-related rules and regulations</strong>, bicycle activists advocate for the reconstruction of the city space, so it could <strong>accommodate the needs of the cyclists</strong>. It is worth knowing that the first bicycle routes were developed in the 1930s, the first in East-Central Europe bicycle city trail was built from Rataje to Winogrady districts, and here, for the first time in Poland, the functionality of contraflow lanes was tested. Poznań was the city which Kazimierz Nowak, a famous traveler and photographer who travelled by bicycle across Africa in the 1930s, was linked with. </p>

<p>gathers pro-bicycle arguments: it endorses <strong>bicycles as the most economical means of city transport</strong>, the quickest, guaranteeing the feeling of being in charge (you freely decide on the possible routes you may take), <strong>ecological and representing urban lifestyle/culture</strong>. Before you choose your own bike, remember about the safety precautions: <strong>not only is it important to know the traffic regulations, but also to be constantly vigilant, to secure visibility and to observe other traffic participants</strong>. Although the bicycle paths are developed every year, the city lacks a unified bicycle network. If you can&rsquo;t use a bicycle path and are forced to cycle on a street, be extremely cautious. If the allowed speed limit is higher than 50 km per hour, you can use the pavement, on condition it is at least 2 meters wide. Also, you can use the pavement when you ride with children under 10 years old, or when the weather conditions are particularly bad (during a heavy downpour, snow storm or fog). <strong>Watch out for kerbs, uneven surfaces and slippery cobblestones!</strong> <strong>Do not cross the pedestrian crossings </strong>(called <em>pasy </em>or <em>zebry</em>) on your bike. You should walk the bike across the street, otherwise you may get a 100 PLN fine. Junctions that have delimited bicycle paths are the exceptions to the rule. It is worth remembering the contraflow lanes, bike lanes in which you go in the opposing direction to the general traffic, they are marked by the symbol of a bicycle and show the direction of the traffic. Taking a left turn is no longer a challenge since the advanced stop lines, special boxes for bikes in the street lanes at road junctions, were implemented. <strong>Use the reflecting bands, we recommend wearing a helmet, too!</strong> </p>

<p> <strong>Malta Ski</strong> makes impossible possible! <strong>It makes skiers independent of snowfall!</strong> It allows to experience mountain enjoyments on a plain! The amusement park in Poznań has two <strong>ski slopes, a chair-lift and a T-bar lift</strong>. The main slope, which is 150 meters long and 18 degrees steep, is for advanced skiers and snowboarders, while the small slope (30 meters long, 14 degrees steep) is designed for beginners. <strong>The synthetic surface, modern snowmaking machines</strong> operating at temperatures below 0&deg;C and the spray irrigation system for temperatures above 0&deg;C make the slopes available all year round. Purchasing a ticket entitles to use the ski and snowboard gear for free (ski boots, skis, ski poles, snowboards).</p>

<p>from 9.00 a.m. to 7.00 p.m. Monday to Friday</p>
<p>from 11.00 a.m. to 7.00 p.m. on Saturdays and Sundays</p>
<p>Another attraction is an <strong>alpine coaster</strong> significantly called <strong>Adrenaline </strong>&ndash; you can ride in a 2-person cart down the 500 meters long track filled with <strong>numerous curves and loops</strong>, speeding up to 40 kilometers per hour. This gravity-driven roller coaster is open on weekdays from 12.00 p.m. to 6.00 p.m., on Saturdays and Sundays from 12.00 p.m. to 7.00 p.m.</p>
<p>A similar thrill can be experienced on the <strong>summer toboggan run</strong>, which exploits the highest elevation in the area and difference in altitude. On this steel tubular construction you can speed down the track up to 50 kilometers per hour. The speed can be reduced by using a hand brake. Remember that the track is closed on rainy days.</p>
<p>The <strong>pontoon ride down the ski slope</strong> can also be exciting. The availability of this attraction can be checked at:</p>

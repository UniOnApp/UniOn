<p><strong>Organized city walks</strong> taking 2,5 h <strong>with Polish and English speaking guide</strong> are held every Thursday and Friday in the summer season (1 May &ndash; 14 October) and every Thursday and Sunday in the winter season (15 October &ndash; 30 April) beginning at 3.00 p.m. in front of the Franciscan Church on Przemysł Hill. The tickets cost 20 PLN (5 EUR) and can be bought in the City Information Center (44 Ratajczaka st.), at hotel receptions and from guides. What&rsquo;s important, <strong>the city walks take place</strong><strong> without fail,</strong> <strong>regardless of the </strong><strong>weather conditions or the number of participants</strong>. Further details can be obtained by e-mail: <a href="mailto:visitpoznan.info@gmail.com">visitpoznan.info@gmail.com</a></p>
<p><strong>You can also enjoy a city walk organized every month</strong> (usually every second Saturday of the month) by the guides offering less standard routes. The Licensed Guides Group (popoznaniu.pl) invites for theme city walks, during which they will for example show you Poznań from the perspective of crime and punishment, Poznań as a book city/ city depicted in books, share scary stories concerning Poznań, or tempt you with May picnic at <em>Luisenhain. </em>The tours begin at 12.05 p.m. in front of the Town Hall and take 1,5 h.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you are looking for a different type of amusement, if you want to explore the city in and out, choose urban games. The project <em>Explore as you play &ndash; play as you explore</em> offers 11 games (among others on the Greater Poland Uprising, specific historical places or famous citizens). All you need to do is download a free route of the game from <a href="http://www.gramiejska.pl">www.gramiejska.pl</a> to begin the search of hidden information, secret signs concealed in architectural details. Your journey, depending on the pace you solve the mysteries, can even take a few hours. </p>

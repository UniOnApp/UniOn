<p>Although <strong>Poznań is one of the most populated cities in Poland</strong>, <strong>its center is relatively small, which encourages going for walks</strong>. What also <strong>benefits pedestrians</strong> <strong>is the 30 kilometers per hour zone enlarged every year</strong>, limiting the speed on the streets<strong>. Some streets</strong>, or their fragments, <strong>cannot be accessed by cars at all</strong> &ndash; <strong>for example Fredry street in front of Collegium Maius, or P&oacute;łwiejska street, which is a pedestrian zone on all its length</strong><strong>, are car-free</strong>. The Old Market Square became a pedestrian precinct as well. Thus, if you like walking, try to hang around Poznań and you will definitely discover all the nooks and crannies of the city. On many routes it will be quicker to reach your destination on foot rather than by public transport &ndash; <strong>in the city center the trams usually have long, roundabout ways</strong>.</p>
<p>We can recommend you specially <strong>designed city tours</strong> as well as destinations you can visit independently. The City Information Center employees, the local guides and city enthusiasts suggest theme routes: the oldest Poznań, Nineteenth-century Poznań, former city fortifications, the Modernism route, Poznań Art Noveau.

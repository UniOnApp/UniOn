<p><strong>Taxi stands</strong> are distinguished by <strong>standard road signs</strong>: black inscription TAXI on white background and a blue framing. The taxicabs should have a proper sign, <strong>a visible taximeter and fare table</strong>. Most often you can find a sticker on the back windowpane with the information about the starting fare and the 1-kilometer fare for different city zones. <strong>The taxi driver should have an ID with his/her picture</strong>. Some taxis have <strong>credit card terminals</strong>. Outside major communication centers (airport, railway/bus station) <strong>corporation taxis await travellers</strong>. Before you hire such a taxi, ask about the fare. It may turn out that the price is higher than normal and the route circular. Remember, you can always <strong>call for a taxi</strong>. </p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t be surprised if the taxi driver asks you where you are from, how you manage the cold weather that had just begun, or which cities in Poland you have already visited. A <strong>small talk with the driver</strong> is the taxi <em>savoir vivre</em>. Once the ride is over, make sure you receive a receipt. </p>

<p>You can identify bus stops in Poznań by a blue sign with a silhouette of a bus, attached to a pole. Bus stops often have shelters <strong>painted green and yellow</strong>, which are colors <strong>characteristic for MPK</strong>, and benches or seats. Sometimes, however, they are only marked by a pole sign and a bus timetable.</p>
<p>Before you hop on a bus, make sure if the stop you are interested in is a scheduled stop or a <strong>request stop</strong> (there will be a <strong>white panel with red letters &ldquo;N/Ż&rdquo;</strong>). If you want to get on a bus at the request stop, stay in sight at the edge of the stop and <strong>wave your hand at the coming bus</strong>. To get off at the request stop, <strong>push the red STOP button</strong> on the vehicle. All <strong>night bus lines stops are request stops</strong>, so <strong>remember to wave at the bus stop</strong>, <strong>and while on bus, check where the STOP button is</strong>. The night bus lines often use tram stops as well. </p>
<p>Bus public transport in Poznań is <strong>handicap-accessible</strong> &ndash; the low-floored buses guarantee an easy access and the vehicles have designated spaces for wheel chairs.</p>

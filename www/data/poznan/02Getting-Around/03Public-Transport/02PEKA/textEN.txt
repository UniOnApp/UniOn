<p>Apart from the paper tickets, you can also buy <strong>a PEKA card</strong>. The PEKA card comes in two versions: <strong>personalized card with or without e-wallet and as a bearer card</strong>. If you opt for the bearer PEKA card, you will be able to buy a bearer season ticket for the chosen tram or bus routes or for the whole network. Besides, you can top up the tPurse account, which is used for paying for single fares, or make small payments from the prepaid account. The PEKA card can be purchased for 27 PLN (the refundable deposit is 12 PLN, while 15 PLN will be added to the tPurse account to pay for single fares). There is no deadline to use the money on your card.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The PEKA card can be bought at ZTM&rsquo;s customer service points in Pozna≈Ñ and selected kiosks selling tickets. </p>
<p>If you are a freshman student, you <strong>can activate your Electronic Student ID card (ELS) in the PEKA system and be entitled to reduced fares</strong>, just like the regular PEKA card holders.

In order to do that, apply for the activation of the card in the PEKA system and visit a chosen City Transportation Authority&rsquo;s customer service point. <strong>You can fill the form</strong> at: www.peka.poznan.pl. Instead, you can just go to one of the City Transportation Authority&rsquo;s customer service points and activate your ELS there.&nbsp;</p>

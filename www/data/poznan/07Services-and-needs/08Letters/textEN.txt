<p>Nowadays the possibility of making bank transfers without leaving home, paying for groceries with a debit card, credit card payments for online purchases, or the reception of salary to bank account, are only a few rudimentary actions. Thus, it seems essential to have a bank account. Almost all banks offer student accounts, or bank accounts cater for the needs of young people.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whilst choosing the right bank, there are a few aspects you should consider:</p>
<ol>
<li>What is the cost of using the account (transfers, using ATM&rsquo;s, debit card);</li>
<li>Access to money (ATM&rsquo;s, cash deposit machines, internet banking);</li>
<li>Contact with the bank and the quality of customer service.</li>
</ol>

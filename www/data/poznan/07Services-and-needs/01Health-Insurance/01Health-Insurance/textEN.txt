<p>Embarking on a journey, remember that it&rsquo;s better to be safe than sorry; be precaucious and purchase an <strong>insurance policy</strong>. It&rsquo;s an essential element of every trip, especially if you <strong>come from a non-Shengen state</strong>, or <strong>outside the EU</strong>. You should acquire an <strong>obligatory health insurance for foreigners</strong> in the Shengen zone.</p>
<p>If you buy insurance, you&rsquo;ll be <strong>eligible for using help</strong> <strong>in unforeseen circumstances</strong>, such as <strong>sudden illness</strong>, or <strong>unfortunate accident</strong>. In any such case, the costs of <strong>medical help</strong>, <strong>hospital treatment</strong>, or a <strong>visit to a dentist</strong> will be covered, or you will receive a <strong>reimbursement of costs</strong>. </p>
<p>The insurance is intended for <strong>foreigners visiting Europe</strong> individually as well as <strong>on business trips</strong>, foreign students, tourists and sportsmen. Health insurance is compulsory for everyone applying for a <strong>Shengen visa</strong>, <strong>temporary residence card</strong>, or a <strong>work permit</strong>.</p>
<p>A student from a non-EU state can obtain a voluntary insurance in the National Health Fund. An agreement is signed upon submitting a registration form, a certificate confirming student status, and a passport. Within 7 days the student is obliged to register in the National Insurance Service and submit a ZUS ZZA form.</p>

<p>A few big and plenty of smaller <strong>mobile network providers</strong> <strong>operate</strong> in Poland. The biggest and most popular are: <strong>Orange, Plus, T-Mobile, </strong>and<strong> Play, </strong>and the smaller<strong>: Heyah, NJU mobile, Virgin mobile, LICAmobile, PLUSH, </strong>or<strong> mBANK mobile. </strong></p>
<p>The operators <strong>offer</strong> <strong>contract cell phone plans</strong> as well as prepaid options, and even the so-called <strong>mix options</strong>. All SIM cards, including the <strong>prepaid plans</strong>, <strong>have to be registered</strong>. If your contract is about to finish, but you weren&rsquo;t <strong>satisfied</strong> with your <strong>current</strong> service provider, you can <strong>switch</strong> mobile network <strong>keeping your old phone number</strong>. The <strong>new mobile network provider</strong> <strong>will go through all the formalities</strong> and transfer the number for you. International exchange students usually opt for the prepaid plans, which don&rsquo;t require <strong>signing a </strong>long-term<strong> contract</strong> (those usually spread over a period of 2 years). You can choose different plans and SIM cards depending on the provider and the purpose it will fulfill i.e. whether you will only <strong>make phone calls</strong>, or send messages, or <strong>use the Internet</strong> (<strong>starting at 5 PLN</strong>).</p>
<p>You can buy prepaid cards at <strong>authorized dealers&rsquo;</strong>, <strong>in kiosks</strong>, or <strong>at cash desks</strong> in shops, also in small local stores.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Customer service points</strong> of mobile network providers can be found all around the city, but it&rsquo;s easiest to find them in <strong>shopping malls</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In 2017 Polish mobile network providers implemented EU rules and <strong>resigned from</strong> <strong>roaming charges</strong>, so you don&rsquo;t need to switch SIM cards to avoid high bills for using your mobile phone abroad.</p>

<p>Poznań is a large <strong>academic hub</strong>, which ranks fourth as regards the number of students in Polish cities. No wonder that there aren&rsquo;t <strong>enough</strong> places in <strong>residence halls </strong>for all students.</p>
<p>Still, students&rsquo; lodging is not a matter for concern &ndash; the real estate market in Poznań offering rooms and apartments to rent is thriving. </p>
<p>When deciding upon the rental, students first and foremost take into account the <strong>access to city transportation</strong> system, allowing fast commuting to their universities. If you, however, expect not only a good <strong>location</strong>, but also a better <strong>housing quality</strong>, you&rsquo;ll also find offers of apartments furnished with high-quality equipment.</p>
<p>Living in the <strong>downtown</strong> has its <strong>pros</strong> (good access to the network of public transport, closeness of shops, cinemas, and universities), and <strong>cons</strong> (loud noise, less secure neighborhood). </p>
<p>If you favor the proximity of green areas and sports facilities, search for an apartment in: Łazarz, Grunwald, Rataje, or Nowe Miasto <strong>districts</strong>. If you prefer a flat in a place well connected to the city center, but you don&rsquo;t care about the green areas, the Jeżyce district will be perfect for you. Except for the Sołacki Park, there aren&rsquo;t many places for active outdoor leisure there. You can go to the Rusałka Lake if you have more time on your hands though.</p>
<p>Fancy entertainment and cultural events? The area of the Old Market Square and its surroundings (Wilda, Garbary) will be the best for you. The drawbacks of living in this part of the city are the noise and quite a number of drunk folks roaming the streets at night. </p>
<p>Piątkowo district abounds with rental offers. <strong>Blocks of flats</strong> and <strong>high-rise buildings </strong>dominate the area. Thanks to PST (<strong>Poznań Fast Tram</strong>), it is well connected with the city center. </p>
<p>The safest way to rent a flat is to visit <strong>real estate agency</strong>, which will help you <strong>complete </strong>all the required<strong> formalities</strong> and will i<strong>ntermediate in the contact with the flat&rsquo;s owner</strong>. There are a lot of real estate agencies in Poznań. You can also find their offers at: </p>

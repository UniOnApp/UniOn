<p>What is dance for you? <strong>Free expression</strong>, a manifestation of individuality, the <strong>simplicity of motion</strong>? Rhythm? A <strong>symbolic message</strong>? Whatever your answer may be, Poznań will give you various opportunities to <em>experience</em> dance. We&rsquo;ll invite you to group dances, to small clubs and professional dance schools; we&rsquo;ll prepare a unique lesson on the history of dance; you&rsquo;ll face different styles of dance. If you prefer liberty &ndash; choose dance improvisation. If you value precision and perfection of performance &ndash; select contemporary dance. If you&rsquo;re searching for something unstated in dance &ndash; go to Polish Dance Theater. Poznań will literally and metaphorically move you.</p>
<p><strong>Polish Dance Theater &ndash; Poznań Ballet</strong></p>
<p>The theater&rsquo;s performances transcend the genre characteristics, illustrate the <em>dramatic character of a body in motion</em>, combine the <strong>poetic expression </strong>with the <strong>Avant-garde demand for experimentation</strong>. It&rsquo;s a <strong>visually unique approach<em>, </em></strong>inspired by literature. It&rsquo;s enough to remind the ensemble&rsquo;s declaration &ndash; an endeavor to bring out <em>fear, conservatism, nostalgia, melancholy, escape, illness and meaning &ndash; the whole spectrum of human suffering, secrets, which live hidden in the shadows of the modern times</em>, or the titles of performances: <em>The Architecture of Light, Let the Living Bury the Dead, Harvest, </em>or <em>Bitterness</em>. There&rsquo;s a reason why the creators use the term <strong><em>laboratory </em></strong>(of word/age/motion) in their projects &ndash; it&rsquo;s a theater searching for new <strong>forms of expression</strong>, open to <strong>interdisciplinarity, influencing the social context</strong>, bringing up the history and theory of dance. You should really watch a performance &ndash; you&rsquo;ll probably see the majority of the spectacles in the program. Look for performances, which aren&rsquo;t in the current <strong>repertoire</strong>. Pay particular attention to <strong>retrospective performances</strong> <em>That&rsquo;s a Pity You Are Not Here </em>and <em>Good You&rsquo;re Here </em>&ndash; you can watch fragments of the previous outstanding performances, such as <em>The Fight Between the Carnival and The Lent</em>, <em>Carmen</em>, <em>Finality</em>, or <em>The Dove&rsquo;s Necklace</em>. Find out who Conrad Drzewiecki was, or why the theater is unequivocally associated with Ewa Wycichowska and Iwona Pasińska.</p>
<p>The group&rsquo;s activities also include the promotion of communal motion &ndash; thematic meetings are organized at the courtyard of the Ballet School, bring back the long forgotten word <strong><em>potańc&oacute;wka</em> </strong>[hop]. The sessions are called <em>Free Your Body!, In the vapors of ease, In Touch, Body Vibrations, The Anarchic Polka.</em> </p>

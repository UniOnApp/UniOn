<p>On the initiative of the <strong>Folk Dance Group &ldquo;Poznań&rdquo;</strong> of the Poznań University of Physical Education, the &ldquo;Integration&rdquo; World Folk Review is organized every year in August. <strong>As the </strong>festival&rsquo;s<strong> name suggests,</strong> it&rsquo;s a meeting of various cultures, a search for the <strong>community of civilization</strong>. Held in the <strong>atmosphere of dialogue and mutual curiosity</strong> are <strong>folk feasts</strong>, workshops on folk culture, and concerts, whilst the city is taken over by <strong>pageants of foreign dancers</strong> from all around the world, wearing colorful outfits and wielding musical instruments. In 2017 the city hosted guests from China, India, Mexico, Russia, Serbia, Turkey and Ukraine. You <strong>can&rsquo;t get bored in this mix of cultures</strong>, hence the <strong>organizers of the festival</strong> speak of the <em>magic of folklore </em>and invite for a <em>folk stroll: </em>discovering the city to the rhythm of music. The stroll <strong>illustrates the concept</strong> of urban space serving as dance performance space. </p>

<p><strong>The history of the fall of communism </strong>in Poland began right here, in Poznań. The strike broke in Poznań&rsquo;s Cegielski Factories, over 100000 people were demonstrating, the crowd protested in front of the Communist Party Headquarters. The workers demanded <strong>bread and freedom</strong>. First shots were fired in front of the UB police building at Kochanowskiego street. This mass rebellion against the communist government was brutally pacified, resulting in the death of 75 persons, 800 were wounded. <strong>The museum exhibition includes photographic documentation from the uprising, oppositionist activities against the regime and the samizdat (underground publications evading Soviet censorship)</strong>.</p>
<p>In the museum you can see a reconstructed typical Poznań family flat from the 1950s, feel the revolutionary ambience of the workers&rsquo; demonstrations, see an interrogation room in a UB police station, or listen to communist party propaganda speeches.</p>

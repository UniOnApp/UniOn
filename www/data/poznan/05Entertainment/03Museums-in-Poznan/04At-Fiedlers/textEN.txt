<p>Go on a bike trip to Puszczykowo where, in the Museum-Workshop of Arkady Fiedler, a traveller and writer, you will experience the cultural variety of the world, you will see the exhibits and souvenirs brought from many a trip. You&rsquo;ll be surrounded by the sculptures and ritual masks (for instance an unsettling mask adorned with a chain, which is said to influence people!), trophies, curios, and musical instruments. A replica of Christopher Columbus&rsquo; ship, a copy of the statue from the Easter Island, a sungate from Bolivia, an Aztec calendar, and totem poles - all come together out of their time and civilization in the Garden of Tolerance surrounding the old villa.</p>

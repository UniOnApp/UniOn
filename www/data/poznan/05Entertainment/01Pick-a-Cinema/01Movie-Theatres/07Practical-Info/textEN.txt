<p>When you purchase tickets to a movie, you are entitled to a <strong>student discount </strong>(tickets cost circa 18-23 PLN). You can buy them online or at the box office open before the screening. A lot of cinemas offer <strong>reduced</strong> tickets for mid-week screenings, for instance <em>Decently Cheap Thursdays </em>in <em>Muza</em>, or <em>Rialto</em>. You can get the tickets just fro 8 PLN, but you have to brace yourself for a long queue, as booking in advance is not possible. Remember that many arthouse cinemas don&rsquo;t sell popcorn, but you can taste other homemade delicacies (for example in the caf&eacute; in <em>Muza </em>Movie Theater). Finally, try to be there on time &ndash; the arthouse cinemas often won&rsquo;t show commercials before the projections ;-)</p>

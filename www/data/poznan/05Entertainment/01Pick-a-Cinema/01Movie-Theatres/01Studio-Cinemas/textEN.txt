<p>Recently, the <strong>small studio cinemas</strong> screening mainly independent European films and world classics have come back into favor. The renovated pre-war movie theaters, or the new <strong>arthouse cinemas</strong> have one thing in common: the audience is the priority and the movies are screened even if there&rsquo;s just one person sitting in the auditorium. One of the oldest vintage cinemas in Poland, whose traditions date back to 1908, is Muza. In the consciously selected repertoire dominate European and amateur films, while the periodically held festivals and films in the framework of the &ldquo;<strong>Decently Cheap Thursdays</strong>&rdquo;(tickets cost 8 PLN) draw in crowds. Another pre-war arthouse cinema, the 100-year-old Apollo (previously named Metropolis), whose characteristically restored interiors lend a 1930&rsquo;s atmosphere to the place, is also worth visiting. The Rialto Movie Theater in the Jeżyce district is yet another vintage cinema priding itself on its rich history - it has been running since 1937. This arthouse cinema belongs to a prestigious EU-funded program Europa Cinemas. Apart from the independent films and European classics, you can also watch the periodical screenings of short films displayed as part of <em>Future Shorts</em>, <em>Short Waves</em>, <em>World Shorts</em>, or the <em>Manhattan Short Film Festival</em>, as well as many historic documentaries. If you decide to drop in on a Thursday screening, the ticket will only cost you 12 PLN. </p>
<p>Another popular cinema among Poznanians is <a href="http://kinobulgarska19.pl/">Bułgarska 19</a> having only a small, barely 50-viewers screen, it guarantees an almost home-like feel. Similar in size is the <a href="http://www.kinomalta.pl/index.php/repertuar">Charlie Monroe Kino Malta</a> whose interior design resembles a small American theater. The walls are adorned with the pictures of movie stars, the image of Charlie Chaplin welcomes viewers at the entrance. <a href="http://kinopalacowe.pl/">Kino Pałacowe</a> in the &ldquo;Zamek&rdquo; Culture Center offers a vast repertoire and numerous periodical events, such as <em>Watch and Talk: Polish Cinema</em>, <em>Klub Kr&oacute;tkiego Kina</em>, <em>Kino&nbsp;Wok&oacute;ł Fotografii</em> etc. Should you fancy discussing a film screening, the &ldquo;Zamek&rdquo; Culture Center Film Discussion Club is worth visiting.</p>
<p>Often the studio/arthouse cinemas organize movie screenings with English subtitles (for instance: <em>Move to Movie</em> in <em>Muza</em>), so visit the cinemas&rsquo; websites to stay tuned. </p>

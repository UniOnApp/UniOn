<p>In the spring and summer time you shouldn&rsquo;t miss out on <strong>movie screenings in the open air</strong>. From Wednesdays to Saturdays evening outdoor projections take place in various parts of the city. The atmosphere is unique and the entrance is free. It is worth starting a movie marathon on Wednesday at 9:30 p.m. in the <strong>Cinema at the Art Backyard in the Old Brewery</strong>. On a Thursday you can visit the <strong>Summer Garden of Pozna≈Ñ International Fair</strong>, while on every Friday in July and August you can go to see the square next to Malta Movie Theater, where <strong><em>Na Rybitwach </em></strong>cinema shows movies in the open air. &ldquo;Zamek&rdquo; Culture Center has its summer cinema as well, the screenings take place at the parking lot in front of the Imperial Castle. On Saturday evenings movies are shown in the Kasprowicza Park (open air cinema <strong><em>Kinoogr&oacute;d</em></strong>). Let&rsquo;s hope it won&rsquo;t rain, though! ;-)</p>

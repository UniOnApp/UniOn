<p><strong>The Stanisław Moniuszko Grand Theater </strong> was built in 1919. Stanisław Moniuszko&rsquo;s spectacle <em>Halka </em>was the first to be staged in the opera theater. At first, the repertoire included theater plays, but with time opera and ballet were staged more often and the theater became one of the most important musical stages in the country.</p>
<p>The outbrake of World War II forced the suspension of the Grand Theater. Once the war was over, Poznań Opera was the first in Poland to reactivate.</p>
<p>Over time the Poznań Opera House troupe started to give guest performances abroad. The Grand Theater also cooperated with musical festivals and theaters abroad, among others in: Baden-Baden, Brussels, Heilbronn, Luxemburg, Xanten and&nbsp;Carcassonne<strong>.</strong> </p>
<p>The Grand Theater&rsquo;s troupe has participated with great success in international musical, theatrical and ballet festivals, awarded with numerous prizes and medals, honored with the Golden Rose of St. George Foundation in Venice, or the special prize of the International Musical Festival in Salsomaggiore for the realization of Verdi&rsquo;s works.</p>
<p>In addition to the main stage, the small Wojciech Drabowicz stage is fit for presenting smaller musical forms. A series of spectacles called <em>Opera kieszonkowa</em> were created, staging one-act works, unfinished, salon music compositions. </p>

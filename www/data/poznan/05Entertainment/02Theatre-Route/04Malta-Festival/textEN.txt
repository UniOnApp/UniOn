<p>If you visit Poznań at the turn of June and July, you&rsquo;ll have a unique opportunity to see how the city turns into one big theater scene, when <strong>The International Malta Theater Festival</strong>, one of the major artistic events in the East-Central Europe, is held. The event has been taking place in Poznań, annually since 1991. The first edition of the festival included manly theatrical forms, however, over time, the festival&rsquo;s format expanded to include other forms of art such as dance and music as well. </p>
<p>The festival presents both the alternative bands and the most popular world-renowned ensembles, and street theaters. Malta Theater Festival is a must-see.</p>

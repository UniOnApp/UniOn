<p><strong>How about some world rhythms? </strong></p>
<p><strong>Festival ETHNO PORT</strong> has been organized in Poznań for 10 years now, being one of the most significant events in the music circle in Poland. Nearly <strong>120 bands and solo players</strong> who <strong>came to Poznań from various places in the world (Africa, Asia, North and South America, and many European countries)</strong> have performed at the festival. Apart from the wide range of international musical traditions that have been showcased, the festival doesn&rsquo;t fail to introduce Polish folk music artists. </p>
<p>With each year, the organizers go to great lengths to invite more and more guest artists. Besides the numerous concerts, also workshops, dance, and educational classes for children and young people are arranged during the few days&rsquo; event. In addition, movie screenings are held combined with meetings, attempting to facilitate the understanding of modern day challenges.</p>
<p>Once a year, in July, Poznań becomes the center of the world, a place visited by artists from all over the globe.</p>

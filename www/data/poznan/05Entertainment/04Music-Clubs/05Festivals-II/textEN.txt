<p>Poznań is <strong>a city of choirs</strong>. A few nationally and globally known choirs exist in Poznań such as Men and Boys Choir <em>Poznań Nightingales </em>directed by Maciej Wieloch, the choirs of <strong>Poznań Choir School founded by Jerzy Kurczewski</strong>, or the Girls&rsquo; Choir <em>Skylarks</em>.</p>
<p>Thus, it comes as no surprise, that since 1998 every two years the International Festival <em>Universitas Cantat </em>has been organized in Poznań.</p>
<p>Over the last ten editions, the audience had the opportunity to admire almost <strong>100 choirs from 26 countries</strong>. Since the very beginning of its existence, the festival was managed by Adam Mickiewicz University in Poznań, <strong>AMU&rsquo;s Chamber Choir</strong> and the AMU Chamber Choir Friends&rsquo; Association. The concerts take place in the University Grand Hall, known for its outstanding acoustics.</p>

<p>Those who are fond of guitar music can take part in the extraordinary event called the Polish Guitar Academy, which has been organized for the past ten years. There is more to it than just a series of concerts. Every summer the festival <strong>propagates guitar music in several dozen of places in the Greater Poland region</strong>, giving concerts and running workshops, which makes it the one and only musical event of this size and importance in Europe, with guitar as the key instrument. The festival&rsquo;s program includes events for all musical tastes and fans of the instrument. </p>
<p>Entrance to the majority of concerts is free. Instead, there is a charity raise for the Wielkopolan Bona Fide Association and the Niesiemy Nadzieję Foundation. The tickets are replaced with guitar-shaped ginger cakes. </p>

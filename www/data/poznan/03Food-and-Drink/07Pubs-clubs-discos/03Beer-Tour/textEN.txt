<p>Beer is <strong>one of the most favorite alcoholic beverages</strong> Poles like to drink when they go out. This Polish beverage has a long rich tradition and recently has come back into favor. Poles&rsquo; beer drinking habits include drinking classic pale lager from a cask, mixed with juice or through a straw (don&rsquo;t be surprised by a green-colored beer), and even cocktails with beer! Winter season is the time for <strong>mulled</strong> <strong>ale</strong>, while in the summer every variety of beer is consumed, preferably <strong>in beer gardens</strong>. These are outside patios localized in the heart of the city, the Old Market.</p>
<p><strong>Poznań is also famous for the <em>Lech </em>Brewery</strong>, the main sponsor of Poznań soccer team, which bears the same name. Located in the center of the city is one of the modern highlights of Poznań, the Old and New Brewery &ndash; the shopping, arts and business center in the readapted old brewery buildings.</p>
<p>Numerous places offer a chance of sampling local beer, brewed in local mini-breweries, and even observe the brewing technique. The most famous place of such kind is <em>Brovaria</em>.&nbsp;</p>

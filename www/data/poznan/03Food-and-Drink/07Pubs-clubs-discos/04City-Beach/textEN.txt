<p><strong>A beach in the center of the city?</strong> Why not? In Poznań, everything is possible! Near the Old Market, by the Warta river, an exceptional spot was set up where you can relax, get a tan, play beach volleyball, have a chat drinking a refreshing beverage, or listen to concerts in the evenings, feeling like you were on an actual beach. In addition, you can enjoy the gorgeous city panorama from the rooftops of the containers. The place where everybody can hang out was established on the initiative of Poznań&rsquo;s independent artists. The venue is open from May to September.</p>

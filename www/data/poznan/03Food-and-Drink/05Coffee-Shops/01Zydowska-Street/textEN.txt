<p><strong>If you love coffee and cozy ambient coffee shops</strong>, Żydowska street is the place you should visit without doubt. The street, just off the Old Market, teems with enchanting cafes, many of which have <strong>backyard gardens with seasonal outside seating</strong>. As Poles are enthusiasts of coffee, here the beverage can be savored in a variety of ways and in beautiful surroundings. Stopping by the Żydowska street on May 12, the street&rsquo;s name day, is definitely a great idea &ndash; you can sit in one of the cafes and enjoy live concerts. Still, the choice of venue won&rsquo;t be easy. We recommend:</p>

<p>There is a place we can recommend for those <strong>who have a sweet tooth as well</strong>. Cacao Republika is not only one of the most renowned cafes in Pozna≈Ñ, but also the ultimate place for chocolate drinkers. The caf&eacute;, situated in the very heart of the city in a stylish tenement house, just next to the Old Market, attracts many students. The windows at the caf&eacute;&rsquo;s mezzanine overlook the peaceful Zamkowa street. <strong>A genuine thick hot chocolate is served here in more than 20 different ways!</strong> Some of the flavors will surprise you without doubt! </p>

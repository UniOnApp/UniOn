<p>Situated a jump away from Collegium Maius, at a small courtyard next to the Library of the Poznań Society of the Friends of Sciences, you can find an extremely <strong>smooth and cozy caf&eacute;</strong> - <em>U Przyjaci&oacute;ł </em>[At friends&rsquo;]. On offer is a wide range of coffee and flavored tea for summer and winter evenings, as well as some light meals. If you are into <strong>board games</strong>, ask for them at the bar. With ambient music always playing in the background, it is a perfect spot for a cup of coffee in between university lectures, a meeting with friends, or&hellip; a rendezvous. <strong>Little drawers, paper and pencils can be found at every table. You can write a note and put it in the drawer for someone else to read</strong>.</p>
<p>If this is a place to your taste, you must be back for one of the exceptional theatre plays organized by the caf&eacute; theatre. You can buy tickets for the performances in the caf&eacute;. The stage is situated at the attic of the tenement house the caf&eacute; is located in. The atmosphere there is unparalleled and the actors remarkable. If theatre is not your thing, the experience will definitely change your mind ☺</p>

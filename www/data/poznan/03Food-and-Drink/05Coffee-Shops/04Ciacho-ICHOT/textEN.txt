<p>You will surely have an opportunity to visit Porta Posnania, the state-of-the-art edifice by the Cybina river, which is home to ICHOT - the Interactive Centre for the History of the Cathedral Island. Once you have done the sightseeing, <em>Poznańskie Ciacho</em> is an ideal place to grab a coffee. As the name of the place suggests (<em>ciacho </em>is an augumentative formed from the noun <em>ciastko &ndash;</em> cake), various sweets and homemade cakes are on the menu. </p>

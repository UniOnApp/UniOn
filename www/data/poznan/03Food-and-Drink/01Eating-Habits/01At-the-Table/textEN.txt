<p>Poles love eating! They <strong>celebtrate meals in good company, together with family or friends</strong>. On the top of everything, <strong>Poles are famous for their hospitality</strong>. As the well-known adage says &ldquo;Guest in the house &ndash; God in the house&rdquo;. Many research thesis have been written on the plentiful tables and the Old Polish feasts, some of the dishes eaten then were very exotic (for instance roasted storks!). Everything changed in the communist times, when there were scarcely any goods in stores and get-togethers usually took place at homes. Few restaurants were open, including milk bars, which were considered as unappetizing. Nowadays the tendencies are quite the opposite: <strong>milk bars became hot spots</strong>, while thanks to the variety of restaurants and cuisines, Poles tend to eat out more frequently and eagerly.&nbsp;</p>

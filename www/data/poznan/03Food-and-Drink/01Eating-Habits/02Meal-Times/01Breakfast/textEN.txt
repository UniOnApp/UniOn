<p>The typical Polish breakfast is eaten between 7:00 and 9:00 a.m. and it is the <strong>so-called continental breakfast</strong> consisting of <strong>boiled or scrambled eggs</strong>, <strong>sandwiches with butter, cheese and ham</strong>. Some people eat <strong>sausages or cottage cheese with chives</strong>. Enthusiasts of sweeter breakfasts prefer <strong>cereal</strong>, the widely popular <strong>sweet buns</strong> (sweet buns of yeast dough with fruits or cheese and icing), or <strong>doughnuts</strong> traditionally stuffed with rose marmalade. For breakfast Poles most often drink <strong>tea, coffee with milk, ersatz coffee, or cocoa</strong>.</p>

<p>Dinner is <strong>the main and most important meal of a day</strong>. It is mostly eaten between 3:00 and 5:00 p.m., after Poles return home from work. <strong>Dinner consists of two courses</strong>: <strong>soup is usually the first course, while meat, potatoes, vegetables and salad are eaten as the second course</strong>. Poles commonly drink kompot (sweet beverage made of cooked fruits) with dinner and after dinner it is time for <strong>a small dessert</strong>, which is often <strong>a piece of a homemade cake</strong> and a cup of coffee. After such a meal you surely won&rsquo;t feel hungry until evening! </p>
<p><strong>Sunday family dinner</strong></p>
<p>For traditional Sunday family dinner chicken broth is served for the first course, while the main course consists of pork chops with potatoes (or fries), frizzled cabbage and various salads. Kompot is drunk with dinner. After the meal is over, it is time for dessert and coffee. <strong>Families are increasingly dining out, though</strong>. Where? There are hundreds of restaurants on the city&rsquo;s culinary landscape! </p>
<p><strong>Remember to book a table in advance, though! </strong></p>

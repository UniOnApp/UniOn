<p>Don&rsquo;t be misguided by the name &ndash; a milk bar has hardly anything to do with milk. A milk bar is a term describing a bar in which you can have a cheap Polish meal for dinner. <strong>It is a sort of a fast food serving traditional Polish cuisine</strong>. The first milk bars were established before the First World War (over 120 years ago) and served staple dishes made of wheat, eggs and milk. The times of communism in Poland were the heyday of milk bars, which offered cheap and mostly tasty meals, developing into the emblematic restaurants of Polish People&rsquo;s Republic. Many milk bars had been closed over time, but <strong>nowadays they are coming back into fashion, some are even becoming legendary venues</strong>. <strong>The menu features a variety of dishes</strong>, <strong>the prices are wallet-friendly</strong> and, a fun fact, calculated exact to one grosz/penny. During lunch time it&rsquo;s a place where you can encounter queues, though you won&rsquo;t have to wait long. <strong>These venues are nothing fancy, rather modest, but neat</strong>. The bars seem to be places where time stood still, with the staff characteristically resembling the times of Polish People&rsquo;s Republic, although there is much more on the menu than before. The prices of dishes begin from 5 PLN. <strong>You can dine in, or order a takeaway</strong>. The clientele ranges from tramps and the poorest, to businessmen in fine suits. <strong>Remember, it is self-service</strong>.&nbsp;</p>

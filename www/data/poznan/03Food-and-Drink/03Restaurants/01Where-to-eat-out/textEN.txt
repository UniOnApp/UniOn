<p><strong>Eating establishments</strong></p>
<p><em>Restauracja</em>, <em>stoł&oacute;wka</em>, <em>jadłodajnia</em>, <em>bar mleczny</em>, <em>bistro, zajazd, gospoda, gościniec, bar, knajpka, lunch bar, pizzeria, bufet</em> - are probably all terms in Polish denoting places where you can grab something to eat. How are they different from each other? How to differentiate these confusing terms? </p>
<p>Sometimes they don&rsquo;t differ at all, as the owners label their restaurants Old Polish names (for instance <em>gościniec </em>[tavern], or <em>gospoda </em>[eating house]). For the most part, however, <strong>the difference regards the prices of meals, the way of serving them, the size of the establishment and, sometimes, its clientele</strong>. <strong><em>Stoł&oacute;wki</em></strong> are canteens where students can eat on campus, while <em>stoł&oacute;wki pracownicze </em>[staff canteens] are places (for example in factories) where employees eat. Smaller canteens are often called <strong><em>bufety</em></strong> [buffets], you may come across such designation at some of the faculties. <strong><em>Jadłodajnie</em></strong> are mostly diners by the churches and orders, which serve meals to the poor. <strong><em>Bistro</em></strong> and <strong><em>bar</em></strong> are Polish equivalents of fast foods, small venues, which serve fast and cheap meals, whereas <em>lunch bar</em> and <em>pizzeria</em>, as their names suggest, are places where you can eat lunch (dinner) or pizza. <strong><em>Zajazd</em></strong> is an inn by a main road or highway, while <strong><em>knajpka</em></strong> is a colloquial and general name of a small cozy eatery. Still, don&rsquo;t be misguided by a name of a place, because often a cafe and a restaurant by day can serve as a club or disco by night.</p>
<p>Having trouble deciding where to eat out? If you and your friends each prefer different cuisines, you should go to the Old Brewery. In the old part, at the top floor, you can find many venues offering <strong>various cuisines (Chinese, Mexican, Polish, Asian, Mediterranean, etc.)</strong>, so everyone can choose something for their liking and then <strong>sit together by one table</strong>.</p>

<p>You probably think that Poland has too cold a climate for the vegetables and fruits to grow. You couldn&rsquo;t be more wrong! Although the climate isn&rsquo;t as warm as in the south of Europe, there is <strong>a diverse array of vegetables and fruits grown in Poland</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Fruits</strong></p>
<p>Poland <strong>is famous</strong> <strong>for its vast orchards abundant with apple trees</strong>. You can find many varieties of apples in shops and open-air markets, from sweet small and red to tart big green ones. You should definitely try them all! First and foremost, apples are used as ingredients in desserts (for instance in apple pie). They are also added to various dishes such as pates. Apples can be easily preserved, thus they are eaten all year round. </p>
<p><strong>Seasonal Polish fruits include</strong>: sour and sweet cherries, pears, plums (especially recommended in autumn), peaches, apricots, black currants, gooseberries and fruits of the forest like blackberries, raspberries, wild strawberries and blue berries.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Vegetables</strong></p>
<p>Contrary to the popular belief, Poles eat a lot of vegetables. To each soup Poles use <strong><em>włoszczyzna</em></strong> i.e. <strong>carrots, parsley, celery and onion</strong>. The term <em>włoszczyzna</em> comes from the Italian queen Bona, wife to Polish king Sigismund I, who introduced many previously unknown vegetables to Polish cuisine from Italy (Italy in Polish is <em>Włochy</em>). What is more, Poles eat a lot of potatoes, leguminous plants (beans, peas), and cruciferous vegetables (cauliflower, broccoli, cabbage). Also zucchini, radishes and turnips are eaten, while beetroots, typical Polish vegetables, are not only the main ingredient of borsch soup, but are also served grated with the addition of horseradish, as a side dish.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>You must have heard about the well-known pickled cucumbers</strong> (fermented cucumbers). Let the name not scare you away. It is a traditional way of preserving cucumbers and cabbage, owing to which the vegetables get <strong>new rich flavor </strong>and are used to many dishes as ingredients, or as side dishes. For instance, bigos is made of cooked sauerkraut, plus it is the main ingredient of various salads. </p>
<p>Fun fact &ndash; pickled cucumbers and sauerkraut contain more vitamin C than citrus fruits! </p>

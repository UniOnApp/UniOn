<p><strong>Located in almost every university building</strong>, bistros are venues where you can drink coffee, grab a sandwich or a hot snack. If you have a longer lunch break, <strong>student bistro</strong> is the perfect place to visit &ndash; <strong>you can have a tasty meal on a student budget</strong>.</p>
<p>Two bistros the students and Poznanians are most fond of are <em>Ogr&oacute;d smak&oacute;w Pani Marii </em>[Mrs. Marias&rsquo;s Garden of Tastes] and <em>Jowita</em>, situated in the center of the city. The largest, <em>Jowita</em>, is located in the <em>Jowita </em>resident hall, in the building with the giant sign <em>Akumulatory</em> at its rooftop, which is easily seen from afar. The other bistro, <em>Ogr&oacute;d smak&oacute;w Pani Marii</em>, is in Collegium Historicum, within stone&rsquo;s throw from Collegium Maius. Both venues are open from noon and their menu offers mainly Polish cuisine. Lunch sets cost circa 15 PLN. The canteens are self-service. Before you enter, you need to leave your jacket in a coatroom. </p>

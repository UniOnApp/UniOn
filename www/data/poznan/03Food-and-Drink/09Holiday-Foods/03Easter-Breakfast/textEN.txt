<p>The Easter Sunday breakfast is the highlight of Easter holidays, the most important family moment. Thorough preparations are made before the holidays. <strong>Blessing of the Easter baskets is a special practice observed on Holy Saturday</strong>. <strong>The Easter baskets, containing symbolic portions of Easter food, which will be eaten for breakfast on Holy Sunday, are brought to church where the priest blesses them</strong>. Among the Easter food Poles put into the decorated baskets are: lamb made of butter or sugar, ham, bread, Easter buns and <em>mazurek </em>(a kind of shortcrust tart baked at Easter). And of course, <strong><em>pisanki</em></strong> the beautifully decorated Easter eggs. There are various styles of decorating and painting the eggs and some people even make a living out of it!</p>
<p>Before the festive Easter breakfast starts, the family members share the blessed egg and wish all the best to each other.</p>
<p>If you decide to stay in Poland for the Easter holidays, be vigilant on Easter Monday traditionally called <strong><em>Lany Poniedziałek</em></strong> [Wet Monday](or <strong><em>śmigus-dyngus</em></strong>) as you might get intentionally sprinkled with water. It&rsquo;s an old tradition that is still observed in Poland.</p>

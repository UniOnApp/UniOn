<p>The 11th of November is <strong>the national holiday</strong> marking the regaining of independence by Poland. Poznanians have a special way of celebrating the Independence Day as it is also <strong>the name day of one of the most important streets in the city, the St. Martin street</strong>. A lot of festivities take place such as parades, feasts, fairs, fireworks, enactments of historical events, concerts and a bunch of other attractions. <strong>St. Martin croissants</strong> became the symbol of this holiday &ndash; <strong>these original pastries can only be bought in Poznań!</strong> The term <em>rogal marciński</em> [St. Martin croissant] is protected under law, not every confectionery or bakery can make it. On the 11<sup>th</sup> of November queues lasting many hours form in the best confectioneries in the city from early morning. But the wait is worth the while to enjoy the taste of a sweet croissant traditionally stuffed with white poppy seeds, nuts and raisins. Remember to extend your best wishes to all Marcins &ndash; in Poland both birthdays and name days are celebrated.</p>

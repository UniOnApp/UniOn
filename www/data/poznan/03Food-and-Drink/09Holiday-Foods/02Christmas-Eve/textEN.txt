<p><strong>Celebrating the Christmas Eve supper</strong> on the 24<sup>th</sup> of December is one of the most important Polish traditions. Poles gather by the table at dawn when the first star appears in the sky. <strong>The Christmas Eve supper traditionally includes twelve simple meat free dishes</strong>. It is obligatory to have dishes such as red borscht with raviolis, dumplings stuffed with sauerkraut and mushrooms, braised sauerkraut with peas, carp served in several styles, and poppy seed cake for dessert.

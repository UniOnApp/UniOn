<p>The local church is an Evangelical Lutheran Church. The church has seats for 850 people. It&rsquo;s open in summer from mid-May until the end of August, and around Christmas time from the first Advent to Epiphany. In summer, the gospel is read also in English.</p>
<p>The church was completed in 1950. It&rsquo;s a landmark of Rovaniemi&rsquo;s post-war construction: Architect Bertel Liljequist designed the church. A year later professor Lennart Segerstr&aring;le realised the fresco <em>Fountain of Life</em> &ndash; 14 metres high &ndash; behind the altar. The church has an organ that has 45 registers, and it was designed and constructed by the Bruno Christensen factory in Denmark.</p>
<p>On Sundays at 10 am there&rsquo;s a possibility to have English translation at masses.</p>
<p>The church has a red cross at the top of its spire. The cross act more than a religious symbol &ndash; it serves as a guide for planes that are landing or departing from the nearby Rovaniemi airport.</p>

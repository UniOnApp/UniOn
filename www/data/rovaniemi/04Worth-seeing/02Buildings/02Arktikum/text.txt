<p>Arktikum is an interesting building that houses the Regional Museum of Lapland and the Arctic Centre &ndash; and their exhibitions. A visit to Arktikum opens up northern history, culture and nature from an academic viewpoint. Chances are your understanding of the Arctic will deepen even further!</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also a caf&eacute; that serves a buffet lunch, and a library focused on the themes of the science centre and the regional museum. What&rsquo;s more, Arktikum is a popular venue for international conferences and meetings, and even family celebrations such as weddings have been celebrated here.</p>
<p>The architecture of the magnificent building is worth taking a closer look at, too. It was designed by a Danish architect team Birch-Bonderup &amp; Thorup-Waade. The semi-circle shaped entrance was designed in collaboration by architects Bonderup and Lehtipalo, the latter being a Finn. The building was opened to the public on 6 December 1992, on the 75th anniversary of Finland's independence. The semi-circle shaped entrance was finished in autumn 1997.</p>
<p>After entering, you&rsquo;ll see the glass tube of 172 metres. The tube is aptly called &ldquo;the Gateway to the North&rdquo;, because you&rsquo;re literally heading north as you walk from the entrance towards the tip of the glass tube. On your way, you can visit the exhibitions that are located behind the doors on both sides of the glass tube. They&rsquo;re underground, symbolising the way northern animals take cover from the elements by burrowing under the snow.</p>
<p>The Arctic Centre, established in 1989, is part of the University of Lapland.</p>

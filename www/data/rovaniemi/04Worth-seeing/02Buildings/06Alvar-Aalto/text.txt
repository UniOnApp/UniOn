<p>Alvar Aalto (1898&ndash;1976), the world-renowned Finnish architect, left his mark in nearly all major cities in Finland; Rovaniemi is no exception. Actually, even the town plan of Rovaniemi is Aalto&rsquo;s design. Walk the meandering streets of Rovaniemi to see his vision, shaped like a reindeer&rsquo;s head and antlers, come true.</p>
<p>For specific buildings designed by Aalto, you can visit the administrative and cultural centre and take your pick from the City Hall (constructed in 1986), the Rovaniemi City Library (1968), and the Lappia House (1976). All three buildings include many features typical of Aalto, and his handprint can be seen both on the exterior and interior of the buildings. Pay attention to details, even pieces of furniture, as many of them were also designed by Aalto!</p>
<p>As Aalto&rsquo;s repertoire was not limited to public spaces, he also designed housing for the needs of the growing capital of Lapland. You can spot his buildings for instance at the Korkalorinne residential area and in the town centre. There&rsquo;s even one detached house, or rather a villa, designed by him in Rovaniemi. You can learn more about this building in the category Lifestyle, where <em>Maison Aho</em> is described in detail.</p>

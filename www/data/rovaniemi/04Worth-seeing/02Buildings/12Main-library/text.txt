<p>Because there are only a few public buildings and caf&eacute;s open in the evenings in Rovaniemi, the main library doubles as the living room of the urban-minded locals. The building was designed by architect Alvar Aalto in the 1960s, housing beautiful reading bays with tall book cases and high ceilings &ndash; they symbolise a fanlike open book. One of Aalto&rsquo;s ideas for creating an interesting atmosphere was to design some peaceful reading areas on the lower level as well. </p>

<p>According to many studies, Finns are passionate readers, at least in the case of newspapers and magazines. The reading lounges are excellent, and, in addition to papers in Finnish, you can find some in English and Swedish, too. The Lapponica hall &ndash; on your left as you enter the building &ndash; is dedicated to publications, art and lectures about Lapland; the Finnish S&aacute;mi library collection is also based there. </p>
<p>In addition to books, music, newspapers and magazines, the library also has a collection of board games &ndash; available for home loan if you have a library card.</p>

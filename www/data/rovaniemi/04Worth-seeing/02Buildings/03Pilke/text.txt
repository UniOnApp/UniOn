<p>A view from a landing plane on a bright day says it all: the centre of Rovaniemi is completely surrounded by forest. As this is the case with almost every city in Finland, it&rsquo;s easy to understand the importance of forests for the Finnish economy.</p>
<p>Today, forest cover roughly three quarters of the land area in this country &ndash; more extensively than in any other European country. To Finns, forests have always been very important: they&rsquo;ve been the main source of income in many families, a perfect place to look for material for building houses and constructing furniture, a nearly unlimited resource of wild game, mushrooms and berries, and one of the best locations available for some peace and quiet.</p>
<p>Speaking of locations, Rovaniemi was not accidentally built at an intersection of the two major rivers <strong>Kemijoki </strong>and <strong>Ounasjoki</strong>. These waterways made it easy to transport timber from the vast northern forests to the growing needs of the forest industry. After the Second World War, the need for timber was bigger than ever not only due to the rebuilding of the nation but also due to the heavy war reparations Finland had to pay the Soviet Union.</p>
<p>Logging is no longer needed, since timber is nowadays hauled by trucks and trains to the final destination. The industry itself is still important, and what a better place to find out about forests and forestry than an award-winning example of ecological wood construction, a prime example of modern Finnish architecture. The Pilke building, opened in 2011, is not only a science centre but also home to the local branch of Mets&auml;hallitus, the state-owned organisation managing most of the protected areas in Finland and supplying timber to the Finnish forest industry. </p>

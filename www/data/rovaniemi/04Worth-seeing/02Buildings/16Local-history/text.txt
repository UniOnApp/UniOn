<p>The Rovaniemi Local History Museum is one of the few remaining buildings that show the residential architecture of the old Rovaniemi &ndash; and the old Lapland. You can&rsquo;t see this type of architecture in many places today because of the destruction that took place here during World War II.</p>
<p>When you visit the museum, you can explore what life was like in a local farmhouse and its buildings around a century ago. The main building is a residential building from the 1840s. Later, it was converted into a museum that became open to the public in 1959.</p>
<p>The museum is open in summer from June to the end of August, but it also serves as a venue for events, such as the traditional celebrations of Midsummer and occasional concerts by local musicians.</p>

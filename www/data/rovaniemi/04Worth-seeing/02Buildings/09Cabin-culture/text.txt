<p> For many Finns, a summer weekend equals spending time at the summer cottage &ndash; or being somewhere close to nature at least. There are around half a million registered second homes in this country, and every fourth Finn owns a cottage together with a spouse or family member. The Midsummer celebrations summon Finns to their summer cottages, and, around this time, urban environments are confusingly void of people. </p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in cabin life, it&rsquo;s easy to rent one nearby for an extended weekend, for example. If you&rsquo;re going to spend the summer in Finland, staying at a cabin by a lake or the seaside is more or less a must for experiencing Finnish summer. Your days will be about about going to the sauna, swimming, rowing, fishing, barbequing, eating and sleeping well, and &ndash; in Lapland &ndash; admiring the Midnight Sun, too. If a Finnish friend of yours invites you for a cabin weekend, you should definitely take the offer!</p>
<p>Nowadays, cabins are equipped with all modern conveniences. They&rsquo;re outright second homes where you can stay even in winter. Peculiarly enough, though, many still prefer their cottages without conveniences such as running water, for example. Chopping wood, carrying water from the lake, and heating the sauna in an unhurried, stress-free way can be seen as rituals that bring people closer to nature.</p>
<p>Some researchers have found that a close connection with nature influences your health and psychological well-being in a positive way. So, in addition to getting to know Finnish cabin culture, a weekend at the cabin is also good for you! </p>

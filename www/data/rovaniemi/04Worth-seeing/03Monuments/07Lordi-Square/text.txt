<p>The Lordi Square in the town centre was formerly known as the Sampo Square, until Mr. Lordi &ndash; originally from Rovaniemi &ndash; and his band won the Eurovision song contest in 2006. To honour their success, the town of Rovaniemi renamed the square.</p>
<p>Once you visit the square, you can see and touch the Lordi band members&rsquo; monstrous handprints placed on the side of the central pillar.</p>
<p>The Lordi Square is a popular meeting point and venue for events and services. Over the year, the square hosts barbeque contests, politicians&rsquo; meetings with their voters, charity events, funny contests, and so on. That&rsquo;s also where the local street train on wheels and horse sleigh rides depart &ndash; they operate when there are high numbers of travellers in town.</p>

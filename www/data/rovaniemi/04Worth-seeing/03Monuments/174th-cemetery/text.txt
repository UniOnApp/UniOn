<p>In many cultures, cemeteries are known not only as places where you can remember your loved ones who have passed away but also as locations where finding peace and quiet is guaranteed around the year.</p>
<p>There are some 15 cemeteries in Rovaniemi, and four of them are within a walking distance from the university. These four cemeteries are named simply by numbering: the 1st cemetery being the oldest in Rovaniemi, followed by the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th. The other cemeteries are named after their location, usually a bit further away from the town centre.</p>
<p>The first and second cemeteries are located next to the main church, whereas the third and fourth cemeteries &ndash; next to each other &ndash; are within a five-minute walk from the university.</p>
<p>Cemeteries are open to the public around the year. Visit any of the four cemeteries during national holidays, especially around Christmas, Easter, All Saints&rsquo; Day or the Finnish Independence Day (6 December) to see thousands of candles lit to commemorate the dead.</p>
<p>Many of the local celebrities have their final resting place in Rovaniemi. One of them, also mentioned in another part of this app, is <strong>N&auml;tti-Jussi</strong> &ndash; the legendary lumberjack and a storyteller extraordinaire. Try finding his memorial stone in the 4th cemetery: his complete name is <strong>Juho Vihtori N&auml;tti</strong>.</p>

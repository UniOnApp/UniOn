<p>The <strong>vappu</strong> celebration is one of the biggest spring festivals in Finland. Developed originally from pagan religious beliefs, the spring festival has become popular nationwide. May Day (1 May) is International Worker&rsquo;s Day. Students and workers all over Finland traditionally celebrate <strong>vappu</strong>. </p>
<p>On May Day Eve (30 April), we usually visit local pubs and restaurants to start the celebration. Together with friends and family, we gather in parks and enjoy picnics. Snow is never a surprise! Many people wear different kinds of carnival costumes.</p>
<p>Restaurants usually serve brunches on May Day (1 May). The most common drink is <strong>sima</strong>, a sweet mead drink, spiced with lemon and raisins. People enjoy eating sugar-coated doughnuts called <strong>munkki</strong> and funnel cakes called <strong>tippaleip&auml;</strong>.</p>
<p>Vappu celebrations sometimes last for a week, especially among students. Students organise a lot of events and may wear the traditional white student cap, the one received when graduating from high school, and faculty overalls. It&rsquo;s all about the colours!</p>
<p>In Helsinki, students gather around the Havis Amanda statue to put a white student cap on the statue&rsquo;s head; a tradition since 1932. In Rovaniemi, the highlight of the Vappu Eve, for university students, is at Mr. Lumberjack&rsquo;s (<strong>J&auml;tk&auml;npatsas</strong>) statue: students first wash the statue and then place a student cap on its head. </p>
<p>Celebrations continue throughout the night, all the way until the next morning.</p>

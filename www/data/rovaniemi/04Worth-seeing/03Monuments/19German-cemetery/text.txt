<p>The Second World War left its marks all over Europe &ndash; and Lapland is no exception. As you&rsquo;ve probably noticed, Rovaniemi has a remarkably low number of old buildings; a fact that reminds us of the not-so-distant past.</p>
<p>From the Finnish perspective, WWII can be devided into three separate military conflicts: The Winter War (1939&ndash;40), the Continuation War (1941&ndash;44), and the Lapland War (1944&ndash;45). </p>
<p>The first two wars, fought between Finland and the Soviet Union, had already left their marks on the young Finnish nation that had become independent only in 1917. In September 1944, the Moscow Armistice finally ended the hostilities, but also presented new challenges. According to its conditions, Finland was to pay extensive war reparations, cede significant areas, and expel all German troops from Finland within 14 days.</p>
<p>The deadline for the withdrawal of the German forces came and went. Following the strict conditions of the armistice, Finland had no option but to speed up the process &ndash; which resulted in the Lapland War. In the seven months to follow, most of Lapland was affected by the conflict, and Rovaniemi was left in smoking ruins.</p>
<p>Today, very much of the Finnish military effort is aimed at keeping peace. Visiting the German Soldiers&rsquo; Cemetery and Memorial in Norvaj&auml;rvi certainly gives an idea why.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s impossible to picture Rovaniemi without its famous landmark, the Lumberjack&rsquo;s Candle Bridge. Despite its relatively young age &ndash; the bridge was constructed only in 1989 &ndash; it has served as the centrepiece in innumerable photos taken by visitors and locals.</p>
<p>The function of the brigde is, of course, to connect the two banks of the Kemijoki river. However, it also brings together tradition and modern times by serving as a reminder of the long logging tradition that the river has seen. Not obvious to all viewers, the two central pillars of the bridge are designed to resemble something called <em>the lumberjack&rsquo;s candle</em> (in Finnish: <strong>j&auml;tk&auml;nkynttil&auml;</strong>) &ndash; a two-foot long makeshift candle made by sawing deep cuts into a log and lighting a fire to one of its ends. Lumberjacks used these not-so-petite &ldquo;candles&rdquo; not only for light but also for preparing meals &ndash; and perhaps even for their aesthetic value.</p>
<p>The bridge is also one of the nicest locations for spectacular pictures of the seemingly endless summer nights. Don&rsquo;t be surprised to see groups of tourists with their cameras both on and around the bridge, especially during bright summer nights.</p>

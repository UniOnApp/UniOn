<p>The uniqueness of this belvedere &ndash; in addition to the exceptionally fine view overlooking the town &ndash; is its location: it&rsquo;s in the middle of the forest, but still in a very central part of Rovaniemi. The Ounasvaara belvedere gives you two types of impressions: You&rsquo;ll easily feel that you&rsquo;re on an outdoor adventure in a pristine, peaceful forest. Yet, at the same time, you&rsquo;re not far away from the urban lifestyle including studies, friends, caf&eacute;s and bars. You can easily recognise <strong>J&auml;tk&auml;nkynttil&auml;</strong> (the Lumberjack&rsquo;s Candle Bridge) from the belvedere and use it as a landmark to find your other favourite locations.</p>
<p>The best vista over the town centre shows you the confluence of the two major rivers: <strong>Kemijoki</strong> and <strong>Ounasjoki</strong>. Next to the belvedere is a small <strong>laavu</strong> &ndash; a half-open wooden construction &ndash; where you can grill sausages and, if the conditions are favourable, see the northern lights. In summer, visitors often collect stones to create heart-shaped stone sculptures on the ground so you can also view them from the top of the belvedere.</p>
<p>You may also see some birds at the belverede. Interestingly, there was a one-year campaign encouraging Finns to build one million birdhouses. The campaign ended in May 2017 and was part of the Finland 100 (years of independence) celebrations. The one million aim was quickly exceeded as Finns around the country rolled up their sleeves and built 1.3 million birdhouses for finches, tits and other birds that like to nest in bird houses.</p>

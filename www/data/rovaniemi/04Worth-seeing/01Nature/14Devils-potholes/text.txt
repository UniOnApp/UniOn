<p>As you know, the Rovaniemi area hides enchanted places full of mystery and secrets. <strong>Hiidenkirnut</strong> &ndash; devil&rsquo;s potholes &ndash; is one of those places! It takes a drive of 25 km from the town centre to get there, and the place is at its best in late spring or summer. It&rsquo;s full of snow in winter and very slippery in the autumn rain, so it&rsquo;s not advisable to go there then.</p>
<p>According to the legend, the potholes were created by <strong>Hiisi</strong>, the devil who once upon a time lived at the site. It all started when Hiisi heard that a Swedish bishop had a plan to convert local people along the Kemijoki river from their pagan ways into Christianity. The devil decided to prevent the bishop&rsquo;s plan and dug himself a deep hole in the rock. He also made a poisonous potion and waited in the hole for the enemies to arrive. When they arrived, Hiisi tried hard to defeat them but was unsuccessful. Hiisi fled the place and never returned. In his anger, he left very large boulders and potholes behind.</p>
<p>Another story of the creation of these potholes takes place around 10,000 years ago &ndash; at the end of the Ice Age. At the time, the continental ice sheet was retreating and very powerful meltwater flows at the base of the ice sheet eroded the ground, creating formations in it. At this site, the meltwater flows drilled holes in the rock with the help of big stones. The walls of these potholes are so incredibly smooth and polished that it&rsquo;s easy to think they were crafted by someone. So, it&rsquo;s no wonder that folk tales about their creation exist, too!</p>
<p>The place has 14 potholes. Three of them are among the largest in Finland, as they&rsquo;re 15, 10 and 9 metres deep. The deepest one is also largest in diameter, spanning altogether 8 metres from one side to the other.</p>

<p>The Arctic garden in the Arktikum grounds is a picturesque park with a variety of plants that have adapted to the harsh northern conditions. Go there to spot northern survivors such as <strong>tornionlaaksonruusu </strong>(Rosa majalis &ldquo;Tornedal&rdquo;), <strong>pohjanpaju </strong>(Salix lapponum), <strong>harmaalepp&auml; </strong>(Alnus incana), <strong>kotkansiipi </strong>(Matteuccia struthiopteris) and a whole bunch of other bushes, trees and small plants.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll also find copies of some ancient runestones and runic symbols in the garden and a statue representing an artistic view of N&auml;tti-Jussi &ndash; a legendary lumberjack from the early 1900&rsquo;s. The statue was created by Risto Immonen, a local artist.</p>
<p>The Arctic garden is a wonderful spot for admiring the northern lights, too, as its shoreline faces north. In summer, you can enjoy the midnight sun in the garden while having a latenight picnic.</p>
<p>The Arctic garden is maintained by the University of Lapland.</p>

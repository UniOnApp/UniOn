All plants great and small compete for resources such as 24\/7 sunlight and streams of water created by melting snow. Take a moment to walk around and look for more or less familiar flowers and other beautiful plants!<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Here are some of the typical wild flowers growing all over Rovaniemi:<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>apila<\/strong> clover<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>kielo<\/strong> lily-of-the-valley<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>kullero<\/strong> globeflower<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>maitohorsma<\/strong> rosebay willowherb, fireweed<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>niittyleinikki<\/strong> buttercup<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>puna-ailakki<\/strong> red campion<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>p&auml;iv&auml;nkakkara<\/strong> moon daisy<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>voikukka<\/strong> dandelion<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Some of the plants are so common that they&rsquo;ve made their way into Finnish poetry and songs.

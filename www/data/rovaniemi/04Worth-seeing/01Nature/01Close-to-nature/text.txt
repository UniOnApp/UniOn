<p>Finns have a special connection with nature. Even in the 21st century, people still find nature soothing, almost therapeutic. Luke &ndash; short for Luonnonvarakeskus, the Natural Resources Institute Finland &ndash; has published research on, for example, the health benefits of nature-based recreation: some of the research shows that your body benefits from clear stress-reducing effects of even a short stay in a park or woodland.</p>
<p>Approximately every fourth Finn owns a summer cabin. Some are of course jointly owned by couples and families, but there are some 490,000 second homes registered around the country. To nurture the close connection with nature, some Finns even prefer their second home without modern conveniences, such as running water.</p>
<p>As a growing body of research indicates that contact with nature influences your health and psychological well-being in a positive way, it&rsquo;s not such a bad idea to have a close connection with nature &ndash; it&rsquo;s good for you! Enjoy the numerous trails around Rovaniemi and Lapland!</p>
<p>The <strong>Koivusaari</strong> (literally: Birch island) nature trail is located about two kilometres from the town centre, in the delta of the Ounasjoki river. It&rsquo;s flooded in late spring or early summer &ndash; depending on the year &ndash; but it&rsquo;s well suited for excursions at other times. The delta islands are low sand islands and sandbanks with some valuable flora and fauna. You can see sheep grazing on some of the islands in summer.</p>

  "talk": "<p>Because Rovaniemi is located at the confluence of two major rivers, the annual spring flood is quite a spectacle. Most springs, the whole Koivusaari area is completely below water for some time. It&rsquo;s an exciting time with so much going on in nature if you just stop to look at it more closely. Every year people place bets about the date of the ice break-up, for example.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Annual weather patterns are often dissimilar to each other in Lapland: one summer can be very hot from mid-May to late August, whereas another summer we may struggle to reach temperatures above 20 degrees centigrade. Sometimes it can even snow in June! <\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>The agricultural tradition has been a source of wisdom with information passed on from generation to generation. In agriculture, spring has been a time of predicting and preparing for the weather pattern of the upcoming summer. The behaviour and appearance of animals &ndash; such as frogs, mosquitoes, migratory birds and bears &ndash; were interpreted before modern times; some still do it for fun. People have passed on their wisdom as rhymes, many of which still live on:<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Kuu kiurusta kes&auml;&auml;n<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p><strong>puoli kuuta peipposesta<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p><strong>v&auml;st&auml;r&auml;kist&auml; v&auml;h&auml;sen<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p><strong>p&auml;&auml;skysest&auml; ei p&auml;iv&auml;&auml;k&auml;&auml;n.<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>P&auml;&auml;skynen<\/strong>, one of the words in the rhyme, belongs to a group of ancient Finnish words that have survived the times. This says something about the significance of the rhyme and, of course, the word itself. <\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Have you seen any of the migratory birds mentioned in the rhyme? When you understand the rhyme, you&rsquo;ll be able to tell your friends when summer will arrive!<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>kuu, kuukausi<\/strong> a month<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>kiuru<\/strong> a lark (a bird)<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>-sta<\/strong> ending means &ldquo;from&rdquo;<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>kes&auml;<\/strong> summer<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>kes&auml;&auml;n<\/strong> to summer<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>puoli<\/strong> half<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>peipponen<\/strong> a finch (a bird)<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>v&auml;st&auml;r&auml;kki<\/strong> a wagtail (a bird)<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>v&auml;h&auml;nen<\/strong> a little, a bit<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>p&auml;&auml;skynen<\/strong> a martin, a swallow (a bird)<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>ei<\/strong> no<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>p&auml;iv&auml;<\/strong> a day<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>",

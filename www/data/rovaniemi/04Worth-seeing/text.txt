<p>Rovaniemi is an exotic, vibrant town in the Far North. Sometimes in summer it&rsquo;s difficult to remember that we&rsquo;re truly situated at these northern latitudes when people are walking around the town in t-shirts and shorts. Then again, winter never fails to arrive to remind us of our geographical location &ndash; that&rsquo;s when layers of clothing and a hat and mittens come in handy.</p>
<p>The climate is something that makes Rovaniemi exotic, but it&rsquo;s by no means the only thing. There&rsquo;s plenty to explore in the local architecture, history, folklore, and art &amp; design scene.</p>

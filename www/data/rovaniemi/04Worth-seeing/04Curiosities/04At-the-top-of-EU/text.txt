<p>Located at the Arctic Circle, in the heart of Finnish Lapland, the University of Lapland has one of the most unique university locations in the world. It&rsquo;s officially the northernmost university in the EU!</p>
<p>Even though the university may seem as if it&rsquo;s in the periphery, it&rsquo;s actually very international. Each year Ulapland welcomes many international guests, lecturers and visiting professors. The exotic location also attracts a number of international students. </p>
<p>For exchange students, the university gives the opportunity to experience a completely different and exotic environment from what they&rsquo;re used to. Surrounded by clean Arctic nature, where northern lights often greet you in winter, and the sun never goes down in summer, students usually choose the ULapland to experience the Nordic lifestyle, culture and unique weather conditions. </p>
<p>Not to forget, the university is located in the official city of Santa Claus, who once upon a time, finished his studies at the University of Lapland.</p>

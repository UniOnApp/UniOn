<p>It seems that there are a lot of men in Finland who don&rsquo;t necessarily have a place where they could meet each other. Caf&eacute;s aren&rsquo;t open early enough, so they&rsquo;re out of the question. They may also be too decorated for these men, who just don&rsquo;t feel at home in the atmosphere of a sweet caf&eacute;.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not customary for the older generation to meet in bars either. And the seats in shopping centres are often occupied by other groups &ndash; often immigrants or teenagers.</p>
<p>So, where do these Finnish men meet each other then? Politics and everyday life need to be discussed somewhere with more or less like-minded friends. Well, there&rsquo;s always the gas station. Local gas stations open their doors early in the morning, and that&rsquo;s when the regulars come in for a cup of coffee and a bit of a chat and exchange of opinions.</p>

<p>When it&rsquo;s winter in Rovaniemi, there&rsquo;s no escaping the Christmassy atmosphere that takes over the town. Not that one would even want to escape &ndash; it&rsquo;s charming!</p>
<p>The town centre is filled with decorative lighting, Christmas trees, stalls filled with handicrafts and other goods; there are lots of Christmas tourists, too. Many travellers come from far away to experience the real Arctic winter, to meet Santa Claus, and to &ndash; once in their lives &ndash; cross the Arctic Circle.</p>
<p>Rovaniemi is, as far as we know, the only place in the world where you can cross the Arctic Circle both overground and underground: If you visit Santa Claus Village, you&rsquo;ll find the Arctic Circle clearly marked there for overground crossing. If you go to SantaPark, the home grotto of Santa Claus, you can cross this northerly latitude underground.</p>
<p>In SantaPark, at the end of a long tunnel, you&rsquo;ll find a magical atmosphere with elves, an Elf school, the Elves&rsquo; Post Office, an even a stage show performed by the elves. Ice sculptures and, of course, an ice bar are part of the picture, too. SantaPark gets tens of thousands of visitors every year, and it&rsquo;s one of the most unique places to visit in Rovaniemi.</p>

<p>Have you noticed a particular tone in Finnish music? The common stereotype about our music is that it&rsquo;s minor keyed, making it sound melancholic, wistful and dark &ndash; heavy music being a prime example.</p>
<p>Finns seem exceptionally keen on interpreting and understanding the darker side of life, as heavy rock is listened to and played in all social classes. Have you heard of <strong>HIM</strong>, <strong>Nightwish</strong>,<strong> Stratovarius</strong>,<strong> Apocalyptica</strong>, <strong>Amorphis</strong>,<strong> 69 Eyes</strong>,<strong> Children of Bodom</strong>,<strong> Lordi</strong>, <strong>Sonata Arctica</strong>, <strong>Sentenced</strong>, <strong>Finntroll </strong>or<strong> Turisas</strong>? All are very popular in their genre, and by no means only within Finnish borders! What&rsquo;s more, the gloominess doesn&rsquo;t end here: Finnish pop and schlager-style songs are characterised by dreary tales of lost love, longing and nostalgia, too; you can feel the mood when you listen to them. What is all this melancholy about &ndash; and where does it come from?</p>
<p>Someone may theorise that the further north you go, the heavier and gloomier the music gets. One of the pioneer bands of Finnish heavy metal, <strong>Sentenced</strong> from the neighbouring Oulu, has captured the essence in the song <em>No one there</em>:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>The axe, the bottle and the rope</em></p>
<p><em>The feeling there really is no more hope</em></p>
<p><em>The thought of the great unknown</em></p>
<p><em>And facing it alone</em></p>
<p><em>The dark, the silent and the cold</em></p>
<p><em>The feeling I have comes to the end of my road</em></p>
<p><em>Yes, these are the things I spend my remaining moments with</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>And the wind blows through my heart</em></p>
<p><em>Shivers me one last time</em></p>
<p><em>As I now reach out in the dark</em></p>
<p><em>No one there</em></p>
<p><em>Why did it have to be so hard</em></p>
<p><em>For us to live our lives</em></p>
<p><em>Again I reach out in the dark in despair</em></p>
<p><em>The desperation and the snow</em></p>
<p><em>The feeling of finally coming back home</em></p>
<p><em>The melancholy and the hole</em></p>
<p><em>In the soil so hard and cold</em></p>
<p><em>And the wind blows through my heart</em></p>
<p><em>Shivers me one last time</em></p>
<p><em>As I now reach out in the dark</em></p>
<p><em>No one there</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Your love for me, my love for you</em></p>
<p><em>Things we somehow managed to lose</em></p>
<p><em>Now there's only the ruthless wind</em></p>
<p><em>To blow right through</em></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>It freezes my heart, my desperate heart</em></p>
<p><em>To think we both will die alone</em></p>
<p>That pretty much sums it up, doesn&rsquo;t it? Clearly, the harsh conditions of the northern climate, the long winters, the Arctic Night, and perhaps even the feeling of loneliness &ndash; that can be caused by the sparse population in this neck of the woods &ndash; have left their permanent mark even in the mindset of modern Finns.</p>
<p>Speculations about its origin can be discussed, but it&rsquo;s exactly this type of melancholy &ndash; combined with the darkness and aggressiveness of heavy music &ndash; that have become a recipe for a unique sound. In the late 1980s and early 1990s <strong>Stone</strong>, <strong>Amorphis</strong> and <strong>Stratovarius</strong> noticed &ndash; perhaps much to their own surprise &ndash; that their style had suddenly become an exotic and valuable trademark. The international audience noticed that the comfortless melancholy seems to come from somewhere deeper than the surface of the music: experiences of desperation, disappointments and difficulties &ndash; struggling, coping and making it &ndash; have been passed on from one generation to another. And despite all the odds, generations have survived and thrived, giving reason to believe that life will prevail.</p>
<p>In the beginning, Finnish heavy music bands sang almost completely in English. Later, the audience was baffled to hear Finnish lyrics in the genre &ndash; but soon realised that it works! The same happened in Finnish rap later on. This also posed a new challenge both to the artists and their fans: they truly had to concentrate, perhaps for the first time ever, on what is actually said.</p>
<p>Some very popular bands sing heavy music in Finnish, such as <strong>Kotiteollisuus</strong>, <strong>Stamina</strong>, <strong>Mokoma</strong> and of course <strong>CMX</strong> that originates from Tornio, Lapland; the pioneering band started to sing in Finnish already in 1985. These bands perform regularly all over the country. If they come to Rovaniemi, Tornio or Oulu, go and see their gig!</p>
<p>Finnish heavy music has established itself in the international music scene, and there&rsquo;s more coming, for sure. There are hundreds of bands in this country playing it heavily &ndash; oh, so heavily &ndash; and the international music scene will certainly witness yet another roaring breakthrough that comes rumbling from the Far North!</p>

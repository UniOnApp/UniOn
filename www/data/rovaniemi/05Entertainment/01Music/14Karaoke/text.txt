<p>The myth of silent and reserved Finns will be shattered into pieces when you enter any local bar or restaurant during <strong>karaokeilta </strong>&ndash; karaoke night! Unlike in many Asian karaoke establishments, Finnish-style karaoke is performed on stage, in public. Admittedly, many of the performances are alcohol-induced, but the number of people willing to humiliate themselves is still quite impressive!</p>
<p>Karaoke is available in many bars, pubs, and restaurants at least for a night or two every week. In some establishments, there&rsquo;s only a small screen or two to point out the possibility, whereas in others karaoke is the centrepiece of all action. The selection of songs is usually very extensive in both, and you&rsquo;ll be able to choose between songs in Finnish and English.</p>
<p>To hard-core fans of karaoke, different kinds of sing-offs and more or less friendly competitions are arranged regularly all over the country. Even the first Karaoke World Championships were organised in <strong>Heinola</strong>, Finland, in 2003! Since then, the international competition has taken place in Bangkok, Thailand; Moscow, Russia; Killarney, Ireland; Stockholm, Sweden; Vancouver, Canada &ndash; to name a few of the locations. <strong>Lauletaan </strong>&ndash; let&rsquo;s sing!</p>

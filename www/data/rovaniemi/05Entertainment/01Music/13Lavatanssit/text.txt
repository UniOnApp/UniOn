<p>You might have noticed that Finns tend to have a clear need for a large personal space. To spot this, all you need to do is to observe the distance between any two Finns while they&rsquo;re having a conversation, sitting in a caf&eacute;, or even waiting for a bus on a bus stop. Or try taking a picture of a group of Finnish people. We tend to keep our distance, and even greeting in Finland follows this rule. Yes, we do allow touching in the form of shaking hands, but the ritual is handy in the sense that it also allows you to keep the other person at an arm&rsquo;s length!</p>
<p>Naturally, not every Finn needs an equally large personal space, but it tends to be larger than in many other cultures. And even those of us who are reserved in this way, can make exceptions &ndash; especially for a good cause. Finns have always been keen dancers, at least if measured by the number of places built solely or mostly for the purpose of organising dance events. There are numerous dance halls around Finland, even in the smallest of villages. On top of this, you&rsquo;ll be able to find very specific places for dancing all over Finland in the summertime. These places, called <strong>tanssilava</strong>, dance platform, or <strong>tanssipaviljonki</strong>, dance pavilion, can lure in hundreds of keen dancers who keep on dancing &lsquo;til the sun goes down &ndash; assuming it does!</p>
<p>Oddly enough, the typical collection of styles includes selected ballroom, latin, and swing dances; and all require more or less close physical contact. This might explain the popularity of dancing as the favourite pastime of long summer nights, and the peak in the number of children born &ndash; say &ndash; around nine months after the best dancing season. This was particularly true in post-war years, perhaps less true and more of a clich&eacute; nowadays. Nevertheless, the dancing tradition still remains, and it&rsquo;s relatively easy to find dance pavilions at beautiful locations during the summer, filled with lots of happy people &ndash; outnumbered perhaps only by mosquitoes.</p>

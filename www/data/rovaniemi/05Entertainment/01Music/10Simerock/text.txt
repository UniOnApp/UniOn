<p>The Simerock Festival started in 2002 as a small house party in a local backyard. It was supposed to be an occasion for 20&ndash;30 people only, but around 1,000 partygoers flocked to the event. The local police interrupted the party, but it didn&rsquo;t stop the organisers: they decided to take the event to the next level the following year.</p>
<p>In November 2003, <strong>Simerock</strong> was organised by professional organisers and volunteers. Its location moved from the backyard to <strong>Ounaspaviljonki</strong> &ndash; an outdoor resort mostly used for sports and recreation and as a venue for concerts and other events. That year Simerock had its highest-yet number of visitors yet from all over the country, marking the beginning of its great history.</p>
<p>Today, Simerock is the biggest rock festival in Rovaniemi. The two-day event gets some 10,000 visitors each year. The bands on stage are popular rock bands from Finland and abroad. The location of the festival remains in the Ounaspaviljonki area, as it&rsquo;s one of those places where locals like to spend a beautiful summer day. Featuring a beautiful sandy shoreline, where people go swimming, boating and &ndash; if you can believe it &ndash; sunbathing, Ounaspaviljonki is truly worth a visit in the summertime.</p>

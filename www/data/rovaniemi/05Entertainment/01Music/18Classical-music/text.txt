<p>Finland has a reputation of having a very lively classical music scene. Indeed, in comparison to the size of the country, we have produced a significant number of composers, conductors, singers, and instrumentalists.</p>
<p>One of the great names of classical music in Finland is <strong>Jean Sibelius</strong> (1865&ndash;1957), a composer and violinist, who is often credited with not only composing excellent music but also with helping the young nation to develop its national identity and pride. He&rsquo;s still often the name to start any list of Finnish composers, but there are many, many others who follow; <strong>Oskar Merikanto</strong> (1868&ndash;1924), <strong>Erkki Melartin</strong> (1875&ndash;1937), <strong>Toivo Kuula</strong> (1883&ndash;1918), <strong>Leevi Madetoja</strong> (1887&ndash;1947), <strong>Joonas Kokkonen</strong> (1921&ndash;96), <strong>Einojuhani Rautavaara</strong> (1928&ndash;2016), <strong>Aulis</strong> <strong>Sallinen</strong> (1935&ndash;), and <strong>Kaija</strong> <strong>Saariaho</strong> (1952&ndash;), just to name a few.</p>
<p>In the rich scene of classical music, Finnish conductors have had their hands full in matching the interpretation with the composition. Consequently, there&rsquo;s no shortage of excellent Finnish conductors; a fact that hasn&rsquo;t escaped the attention of high-profile orchestras around the world. The list of internationally famous Finnish conductors includes e.g. <strong>Paavo</strong> <strong>Berglund</strong> (1929&ndash;2012), <strong>Leif</strong> <strong>Segerstam</strong> (1944&ndash;), <strong>Okko</strong> <strong>Kamu</strong> (1946&ndash;), <strong>Osmo</strong> <strong>V&auml;nsk&auml;</strong> (1953&ndash;), <strong>Jukka-Pekka</strong> <strong>Saraste</strong> (1956&ndash;), <strong>Esa-Pekka Salonen</strong> (1958&ndash;), <strong>Sakari</strong> <strong>Oramo</strong> (1965&ndash;), <strong>Susanna</strong> <strong>M&auml;lkki</strong> (1969&ndash;), and <strong>Mikko</strong> <strong>Franck</strong> (1979&ndash;).</p>
<p>For someone who&rsquo;s a classical music buff, Rovaniemi has a lot to offer. For instance, the northernmost professional chamber orchestra, <strong>Lapin kamariorkesteri </strong>&ndash; the Lapland Chamber Orchestra, has its home in the Korundi concert hall. The orchestra produces a very interesting selection of concerts every year, having a reputation of giving first performances in Finland, along with more traditional offerings. The orchestra was established in 1972, and since 1996 it&rsquo;s been lead by the prestigious conductor <strong>John Storg&aring;rds</strong> &ndash; well known also internationally for being an excellent conductor and a very skilled violinist and composer.</p>

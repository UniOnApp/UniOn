<p><strong>Sitsit</strong> is a semi-academic party among university students. The party includes a three-course meal accompanied by a lot of singing and toasting. It&rsquo;s usually a theme party, and there&rsquo;s a certain etiquette to follow. As the tradition of <strong>sitsit</strong> comes from our western neighbours, many of the songs are in Swedish.</p>
<p>When you attend <strong>sitsit</strong> make sure to follow the etiquette! Obey the toastmasters, sing along, speak only when given the right to speak and drink when you&rsquo;re supposed to. Otherwise, punishments will follow&hellip;</p>
<p>If you attend <strong>sitsit</strong>, you have the chance to experience a unique Nordic student event! ESN Lapland is a student organisation that organises most of these events for international students at the University of Lapland. (Please note: Always remember to sign up if you want to attend!)</p>

<p>The northernmost burlesque group in Finland is based in Rovaniemi. The group goes by the name <strong>Midnight Sun Burlesque</strong>, and it was established in 2013, when there was need for a traditional burlesque show for <a href="http://www.rovaniemenwanhatmarkkinat.fi/">Rovaniemen Wanhat Markkinat</a>&nbsp;&ndash; the Old Market Square Carnival. At the time, a small group of local women got together, began with a burlesque course, and soon they gave their first performance &ndash; paving way for increasing popularity.</p>
<p>Burlesque &ndash; <strong>burleski</strong> in Finnish &ndash; is a hobby for all the members, and a very dear one: they&rsquo;re amateurs with pride and extremely passionate about their hobby! To hone their skills, these sassy ladies sometimes take courses led by an experienced burlesque tutor.</p>
<p>Keep an eye out for the group&rsquo;s shows! Midnight Sun Burlesque is active on social media.</p>

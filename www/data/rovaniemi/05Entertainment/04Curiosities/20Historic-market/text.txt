<p>Due to its vivid, long and international history, <strong>Rovaniemen markkinat</strong> (lit. the Rovaniemi market) is a concept of its own! Songs have been made about the event &ndash; and even a movie. There&rsquo;s been settlement in Rovaniemi since 750&ndash;530 B.C.; that&rsquo;s when the first settlers arrived and started clearing land for agriculture and cultivation. People soon noticed that the site at the confluence of two major rivers, <strong>Kemijoki </strong>and <strong>Ounasjoki</strong>, was a handy location for trade and commerce as well.</p>
<p>In 1880, Rovaniemi got the status of an official marketplace, and the first market was held in February 1881. Soon <strong>Rovaniemen markkinat</strong> began to achieve even international reputation, and at the turn of the century, the market was already an important commercial event. It was organised three times a year: a one-week main market in February, the midsummer market and the Mikkeli market in the autumn. It was always a large, multicultural and colourful event, which attracted people from near and far. Russians, Norwegians, Swedes, Jews, Romans and Tatars came here to sell linen, household goods, tools, and so on. The purchasing power among locals was strong, too, as the rising forestry industry had brought wealth to many. The locals, then again, sold goods such as furs to visitors coming from England, for example.</p>
<p>Nowadays, the event <a href="http://www.rovaniemenwanhatmarkkinat.fi/">Rovaniemen Wanhat Markkinat</a>&nbsp;&ndash; the Old Market Square Carnival &ndash; pays homage to the tradition. Filled with music, shows, stalls selling locally produced goods, the event takes you back in time! If you&rsquo;re here in August, do visit the Old Market Square Carnival!</p>

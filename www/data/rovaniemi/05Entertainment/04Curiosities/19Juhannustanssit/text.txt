<p><strong>Juhannustanssit</strong> (lit. a Midsummer dance event) is a fun get-together that welcomes the spring! The event is organised by ULapland students usually in April; two months before the actual Midsummer celebrations.</p>

<p>Taking place in the restaurant and dance venue <strong>Waldemari</strong> at the <strong>Kemijoki</strong> river shore, the evening is atmospheric and it truly makes you look forward to the upcoming &ndash; real &ndash; Midsummer. To secure its nostalgic note and summery feel, there&rsquo;s always a theme-fitting band that plays nostalgic dance music. </p>

<p>The attendees mostly wear vintage-style clothing: ladies wear colourful dresses with flowers in their hair and men wear vintage-style suits. This is because <strong>juhannustanssit </strong>is a concept with tradition: In the early 1900s, it used to be the highlight of the summer to prepare for the dance and take part in it. After all, this is where you could meet your future spouse! </p>

<p>Since those times, new generations have made a charming vintage-style event of it, as <strong>juhannustanssit </strong>no longer presents the only highlight of the summer. Today, our summers are full of festivals that we attend, around the country and the world. Finnish society has changed from an agrarian-based culture of the early 1900s into a modern high-tech society, bringing along a different scope of everyday life; the dance organised by students pays homage to an important tradition.</p>

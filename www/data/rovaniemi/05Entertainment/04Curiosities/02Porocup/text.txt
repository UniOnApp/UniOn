<p>You&rsquo;ve probably heard of Santa&rsquo;s flying reindeer, led by Rudolph, the red-nosed reindeer. Did you know that you can actually see them fly &ndash; or at least make a decent attempt &ndash; with your very own eyes, right here in Rovaniemi!</p>
<p><strong>Porocup</strong> is an annual reindeer cup, including five independent race events and a final event, <strong>Kuninkuusajot</strong>. In the tour, the fastest reindeer in Lapland race against each other to find the best of the best. One of the events is organised in <strong>M&auml;ntyvaara</strong>, only five kilometres from the town centre.</p>
<p>To get an idea of <strong>Porocup</strong>, you can also catch the <em>Rovaniemi Reindeer Sprint Race</em>, the showcase event organised every year in the centre of Rovaniemi. In this evening event, some of the fastest reindeer in Finland and Norway go head-to-head in a exciting and fast-paced way. A 350-metre race track, stretching from the riverside to the Lordi Square, is made of snow that is brought there for the purpose.</p>
<p>Speaking of purposes, it&rsquo;s worth visiting <strong>M&auml;ntyvaara</strong> at other events, too. The place is known for its race track, mostly used for horse races, but there are many other uses as well. For instance, the annual Arctic Lapland Rally in January fills the area with three special stages. The area also has specific tracks for karting and motocross, and several snowmobile races take place there.</p>
<p>For the sporty type, M&auml;ntyvaara offers great trails for skiing and running and there&rsquo;s even a frisbee golf course in the area. Keep you eyes open for the biggest orienteering relay event in the world, <strong>Jukolan viesti</strong> &ndash; the Jukola relay: it&rsquo;ll take place in Rovaniemi in 2020, under the name of <em>Arctic Circle Jukola</em>.</p>

<p>What would you expect from Lappish art? Is it enough to work with Lappish motifs or would one have to use traditional techniques and styles? And how about the artist: does the artist have to be born and raised in Lapland?</p>
<p>Defining art is always tricky, as is answering any of the questions above. For some answers, you could turn to the experts at ULapland, and perhaps attend their lectures on northern art. Another way is to see it for yourself &ndash; there are plenty of galleries, museums, exhibitions, and private collections to choose from in Lapland!</p>
<p>You can start your quest by visiting the local art museum, <strong>Korundi</strong>. It offers interesting exhibitions as well as guided tours and expert lectures on the topic. Who knows, you might become quite an expert yourself, or at least develop a thirst for more! Check out selected works of some of the following artists &ndash; or create a list of your own!</p>

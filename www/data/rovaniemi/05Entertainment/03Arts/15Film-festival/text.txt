<p>If you&rsquo;re here in the summer, don&rsquo;t miss the <strong>Midnight Sun Film Festival</strong> in <strong>Sodankyl&auml;</strong>, Lapland! The film festival was launched by <strong>Aki</strong> <strong>and</strong> <strong>Mika</strong> <strong>Kaurism&auml;ki</strong> and <strong>Anssi</strong> <strong>M&auml;ntt&auml;ri</strong> in 1986. It has since grown into an internationally renowned celebration of filmmaking that takes place in the middle of nowhere, in the last resorts of wilderness in Europe.</p>
<p>The festival is one of its kind: because there&rsquo;s 24/7 sunlight, movies are shown overnight, too, for five consecutive days! The uniqueness doesn&rsquo;t end here, though. The atmosphere is very relaxed, as there&rsquo;s a total lack of red carpets and pretentiousness &ndash; what you see is what you get! Take it easy, you just might end up talking to a famous actor or director while sipping coffee out of a mundane paper cup.</p>
<p>It's simply fun and extraodinary to see internationally renowned directors, filmmakers and moviestars sitting in the same cinema tent, in the same caf&eacute;s, and even around the same campfire as any regular Jane or John Doe. Talking about life comes naturally when there are mutual interests such as filmmaking. Many guests have said that the atmosphere in Sodankyl&auml; is remarkably unique, and that they arrive to one of the biggest festivals in Lapland year after year to soak up the peculiar, friendly and cultural atmosphere.</p>
<p>There are some highlights that you can keep an eye out for. Silent films &ndash; accompanied by an orchestra &ndash; are always sold out. Reserve a seat well in advance! The tent is crammed with people sitting side-by-side, drinking wine, laughing and crying while the movie is shown. In addition, the bright nights offer music movies and karaoke specials for those of us who like to participate and be creative!</p>

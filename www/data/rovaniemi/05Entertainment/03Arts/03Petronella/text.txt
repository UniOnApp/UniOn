<p>At the heart of the most artistic part of the university lies <strong>Petronella</strong> &ndash; a combined cafeteria, exhibition space, event venue and meeting point. With its impressive design and feel of academic fellowship, Petronella is one of the most popular places at the university where students and staff meet over coffee, lunch breaks, open seminars, salsa evenings, karaoke nights &ndash; just to name a few of the variety.</p>
<p>Students have the opportunity to produce events in Petronella; just contact the <strong>Ulapalla</strong> team if you&rsquo;re interested. <strong>Ulapalla</strong> is a student channel on social media, and it&rsquo;s maintained by two university students who foster user-friendly and interactive communication between students and staff. The <strong>Ulapalla</strong> team organises events in Petronella mostly on Friday and Saturday evenings. </p>

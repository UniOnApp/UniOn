<p>The Finnish cinema has a long and rich history. It has grown together with the nation, taking steps to support the development of the national identity or carry people&rsquo;s morals over tough times when needed. It has captured the cultural history of the growing nation, and it has given its audience a chance to escape the reality or build a stronger connection to it. Even today, some traditions include specific movies &ndash; like the habit of watching <strong>Tuntematon sotilas</strong>, the Unknown Soldier, on Independence Day (6 December).</p>
<p>The traditional Finnish cinema was very well received by the audience, and movies were produced in numbers. However, the <strong>Suomi-filmi</strong> movies were not too well known outside Finland. The modern Finnish cinema, on the other hand, is better known by the international audience: several Finnish movies have made it big internationally, and Finnish cinema is appreciated especially outside the Hollywood-scale mainstream markets. That is not to say there aren&rsquo;t any major Finnish films out there; in fact, quite many recent films have been rather succesful all over the world.</p>
<p>There are several internationally renowned Finnish directors. One stands out because of both his style and success, <strong>Aki Kaurism&auml;ki</strong> (1957&ndash;), who has built a strong reputation as a interpreter of the thoughts and emotions of the less fortunate. His movies are full of life, in good and bad, and they manage to build melancholic hope into scenes of sadness and despair. His works include e.g. <strong>Kauas pilvet karkaavat</strong> (1996), <strong>Mies vailla menneisyytt&auml;</strong> (2002), and <strong>Le Havr&eacute;</strong> (2011). Also his brother <strong>Mika Kaurism&auml;ki</strong> (1955&ndash;) has made a name as a director.</p>
<p>For the lovers of Hollywood blockbusters, the name of <strong>Renny Harlin</strong> (1959&ndash;) might ring a bell. With major hits, such as <strong>A Nightmare on Elm Street 4</strong> (1988), <strong>Die Hard 2 </strong>(1990), and <strong>Cliffhanger</strong> (1993) under his belt, he has built a career as a director and producer of movies ranging from small independent films to huge cash magnets.</p>
<p>Finnish actors have also made it to the international arena from time to time. A comprehensive list would be too long, but you could keep your eyes open for <strong>Samuli Edelmann&rsquo;s</strong> (1968&ndash;) role as one of the main villains Tom Cruise encounters in <strong>Mission: Impossible &ndash; Ghost Protocol</strong> (2011). Another pick could be <strong>Ville Haapasalo</strong> (1972&ndash;) who has made it big in Russia; for his performance, check out <strong>K&auml;ki</strong> (Kukushka, 2002).</p>
<p>In case you want to catch more recent Finnish films, here&rsquo;s a short list of movies that&rsquo;ll get you started. Be prepared for subtitles, though &ndash; dubbing is not a big thing in Finland, and it&rsquo;s basically reserved for children&rsquo;s movies only.</p>
<p>Dome Karukoski: <em>Napapiirin sankarit</em> (<em>Lapland Odyssey, </em>2010)</p>
<p>Jalmari Helander: <em>Rare Exports</em> (2010), <em>Big Game</em> (2014)</p>
<p>Timo Vuorensola: <em>Iron Sky</em> (2012)</p>
<p>Klaus H&auml;r&ouml;: <em>Miekkailija</em> (<em>The Fencer</em>, 2015)</p>
<p>In cinemas, all international movies have the original voices; there are subtitles in Finnish and in Swedish. Then again, English subtitles are usually available for any movie filmed in Finnish.</p>

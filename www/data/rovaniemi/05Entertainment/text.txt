<p>Whether you&rsquo;re the social type or more of an introvert, you&rsquo;ll feel good in Rovaniemi: there&rsquo;s plenty of peace and quiet available in the omnipresent natural environment, but the right amount of hustle and bustle is waiting for you in the town centre, too! Go see a burlesque show or sing some karaoke with your friends when you feel like having a party!</p>
<p>The sporty and outdoorsy will find plenty of activities both for doing sports and for seeing a match of ice hockey or football, for example. When you&rsquo;re done with physical exercise, remember to enjoy the vibrant art &amp; music scene. We have the northernmost professional chamber orchestra in the European Union, which goes to show that culture in this town really matters. The Faculty of Art and Design at ULapland does its part here, too, no doubt about it!</p>
<p>The local twist is present, whichever event you choose. Where else can you see a reindeer race in the town square or party hearty under the Midnight Sun?</p>

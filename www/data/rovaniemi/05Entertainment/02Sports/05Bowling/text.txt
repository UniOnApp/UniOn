<p>Ten-pin bowling plays a major role in numerous movies and tv programmes. The sport has also found its way even to the northernmost regions inhabited by people. It&rsquo;s actually not surprising at all, since it&rsquo;s one of the rare sports where complete amateurs can be spotted training next to the most devoted professionals.</p>
<p>There are quite a few bowling alleys in Northern Finland, complementing the offer of ski resorts and spas. There&rsquo;s also one alley in Rovaniemi: the SantaSport bowling alley. Match the convenient location with 12 well-maintained lanes, a wide selection of drinks and snacks, and special events such as cosmic bowling &ndash; and get the recipe for a fun night out.</p>
<p>Bowling might not be your most typical choice for a Finnish sport. However, it has a fair share of connections to Finnish culture as well. <strong>Kyykk&auml;</strong> &ndash; a regional variation for <em>skittles</em> dating back to the 19th century or even further &ndash; used to be the game of choice for many generations. Admittedly, it was played with wooden bats, <strong>karttu</strong>, which were thrown in turns to clear the field of skittles, <strong>kyykk&auml;</strong>. The principle, however, is clearly the same: to knock out pins, skittles and whatnots, preferably in good company. <strong>Kyykk&auml;</strong> is not played too often anymore, even though there still are regular competitions, but you can try out its modern cousin <strong>m&ouml;lkky</strong>, which is a rather popular pastime at summer cottages, parks, and backyards.</p>

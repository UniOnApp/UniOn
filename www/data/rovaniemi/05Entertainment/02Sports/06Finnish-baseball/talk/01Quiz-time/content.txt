You&rsquo;ll know the answers to most questions based on the text about Finnish baseball &ndash; and maybe you can also guess some! Tap to check.<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<div class=\"ht\">\r\n<p><strong>The Pes&auml;pallo World Cup takes place every three years.<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p><strong> Oikein. Correct.<\/strong> The Pes&auml;pallo World Cup has been organised since 1992. Finland has won all tournaments in men, women, and mixed teams.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"ht\">\r\n<p><strong>Players of pes&auml;pallo have to wear a helmet. <\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Oikein. Correct.<\/strong> In official games, each player has to wear a helmet during an offensive inning. This is for the players&rsquo; protection: professional players are known to hit the ball up to speeds of 190 km \/ hour. In friendly neigbourhood games helmets are obviously not needed or required.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"ht\">\r\n<p><strong>Pes&auml;pallo is played on ice.<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p><strong>V&auml;&auml;rin. Incorrect.<\/strong> <strong>Pes&auml;pallo<\/strong> is played on outdoor fields and specific outdoor stadiums &ndash; in the summertime.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"ht\">\r\n<p><strong>An official bat is made of <em>salmiakki<\/em>, the Finnish salty liquorice.<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p><strong>V&auml;&auml;rin. Incorrect.<\/strong> The bats are made of a mixture of glass fibre and carbon fibre. In the old days, however, bats were made of wood. Sometimes wooden bats are still used in less serious games by adults and children alike.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"ht\">\r\n<p><strong><em>R&auml;pyl&auml;<\/em> is the Finnish word used for both the baseball glove and the foot of a duck. <\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Oikein. Correct.<\/strong> Finnish in a rather flexible language, when needed.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"ht\">\r\n<p><strong>The pitcher is called <em>asesepp&auml;<\/em>, meaning: the gunsmith.<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p><strong>V&auml;&auml;rin. Incorrect.<\/strong> The pitcher is called <strong>lukkari<\/strong> &ndash; a kind of a church officer. Since the Finnish name has no real connection with the game, the correct translation of <strong>lukkari <\/strong>might just as well be <em>the pitcher<\/em>.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"ht\">\r\n<p><strong>There&rsquo;s a more informal everyday word for pes&auml;pallo &ndash; it&rsquo;s <em>pesis<\/em>. <\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Oikein.

<p>Finns love their winter sports, no doubt. Surprisingly enough, though, the title of the national sport is often given to a summer sport called <strong>pes&auml;pallo</strong> &ndash; Finnish baseball. Finnish baseball, is a bat-and-ball team sport, played in an open field. Despite the obvious similarities, Finnish baseball has little to do with its distant cousin, (American) baseball.</p>
<p><strong>Pes&auml;pallo</strong> was first introduced in the 1920s by <strong>Lauri &ldquo;Tahko&rdquo; Pihkala</strong>, who had a vision of a sport that would allow Finnish men to practice their military skills in a harmless and friendly way. This shows in many features of the sport: it involves a lot of physical exercise; requires skill, fast reactions, stamina, and concentration; but it also supports team effort and leadership.</p>
<p>Today <strong>pes&auml;pallo </strong>&ndash; or more colloquially<strong> pesis </strong>&ndash; is played all over Finland, and even an international world cup is played every three years. Outside Finland, the sport is somewhat known in Sweden, Germany, Switzerland, Canada, and Australia at least. <strong>Pes&auml;pallo</strong> was also showcased as a demonstration sport in the Helsinki Summer Olympics in 1952. This being said, <strong>pes&auml;pallo</strong> remains hugely popular in Finland, with more than 50,000 players nationwide.</p>
<p>Keep your eyes open for a friendly game of <strong>pesis</strong>, as new players are usually more than welcome!

<p>It seems only natural that cities and towns specialise in certain types of sports. If you ask anyone in Oulu, the number one sport there is definitely <strong>j&auml;&auml;kiekko</strong>, ice hockey, whereas <strong>j&auml;&auml;pallo</strong>, bandy, is the absolute favourite of people living in Tornio. Then again, Rovaniemi residents are known to be fans of <strong>jalkapallo</strong>, football. This may be even a bit surprising because of, firstly, our short summers that are unfavourable to the sport and, secondly, long distances to other football cities &ndash; making it a tad travel-intensive for visiting teams.</p>
<p>Despite all the odds, <strong>RoPS</strong> &ndash; short for <strong>Rovaniemen jalkapalloseura</strong> &ndash; is a team with around 70 years of tradition, and it has the status of the northernmost top league team in Finland. Ever since it was established, RoPS has called <strong>Keskuskentt&auml;</strong>, the local football stadium in the town centre, its home. The stadium was not quite up to standard at the early stages of the RoPS history, making a journey to Rovaniemi an unnecessarily uncomfortable experience to visiting teams.</p>
<p>Since those days, the stadium has gone through a major overhaul. The architecture studio Artto Palo Rossi Tikka, based in Tampere, created <strong>Railo</strong>, the design of the new football stadium. Literally, <strong>railo</strong> means a crack in the ice. Perhaps the stadium can be seen as one, since the turf is heated and played on when there&rsquo;s still a bit of snow elsewhere in town! The stadium is used for skiing in mid-winter by nearby school children. The stadium was completed in 2015, and we&rsquo;re proud to add that the Finlandia Prize for Architecture was awarded to it in 2016.</p>
<p>Those years were good for RoPS in many ways. In 2015, the team became second in its league &ndash; with only one point short of the gold medal. A remarkable achievement, but RoPS has had some surprises up its sleeve before, too, as the team made it to the quarter finals in the European Cup Winners&rsquo; Cup in the late 1980s! The team played against the French team Olympique de Marseille, losing the battle, but gaining lots of valuable experience.</p>
<p>The stadium typically gets its largest spectator groups when either HJK from Helsinki or PS Kemi is visiting. The team from Kemi and RoPS have an endearing love&ndash;hate relationship and have even coined a nickname for their encounters, mutually loved: <strong>j&auml;nk&auml;derby </strong>(lit. bog derby) or <strong>Lapland derby</strong>. If you&rsquo;re in Rovaniemi when there&rsquo;s a match with either one of these teams, put on all your clothes, go to the stadium, and join the thousands of Laplanders queueing for coffee and sausages while shouting <strong>rop-si!</strong></p>

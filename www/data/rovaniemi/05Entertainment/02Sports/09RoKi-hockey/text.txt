<p><strong>RoKi</strong>, short for <strong><a href="http://www.rokihockey.fi/">Rovaniemen kiekko</a></strong>, is the local ice hockey team. The team plays in the second highest ice hockey league in Finland, <strong>Mestis</strong> or &ndash; more formally known as &ndash; <strong>Mestaruussarja</strong>. Established in 1979, the team&rsquo;s home is in&nbsp;<strong><a href="http://lappiareena.fi/">Lappi Areena</a></strong>&nbsp;where its colours &ndash; blue, yellow and white &ndash; fill the arena that seats 3,500 people. <strong>Kuntotie</strong>, where a lot of international students live, is located very close to <strong>Lappi Areena</strong>. Seeing a hockey game here is interesting not only because you can see the local team in action but also because ice hockey truly is the most popular Finnish team sport.</p>
<p>RoKi regularly hosts esteemed guests, such as the CSKA Moscow that plays is the KHL. They&rsquo;ve had a training camp here for a week or two every summer for the last few years. The facilities of Lappi Areena and SantaSport, and the atmosphere of this vivid small town seem to please even bigger teams. As the proud host, RoKi has been responsible for the practical arrangements of the training camps.</p>
<p>The games for RoKi begin usually in late September, and the season carries on until April. Many other teams that play in Mestis come from further south: Turku, Espoo, Vantaa, Imatra, Savonlinna and Joensuu, to name a few. Long distances mean an approximate dozen hours on the team bus!</p>
<p>A special source of pride for RoKi has been the success of its very own player <strong>Vili Saarij&auml;rvi</strong>: he was recruited to the Detroit Red Wings in 2015!</p>

You have noticed for sure that there are quite long words in Finnish, but there are also some short ones, even as short as two or three letters per word.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>The oldest layer of Finnish consists of words representing body parts or words related to nature, mainly. If you look at the following three-letter words, you can see that they all represent very fundamental elements of living, especially in Finland.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>puu<\/strong> a tree<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>luu<\/strong> a bone<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>suu<\/strong> a mouth<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>kuu<\/strong> a moon <\/p>\r\n<p><strong>muu<\/strong> another, the others<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>maa<\/strong> earth<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>suo<\/strong> peatland, bog, swamp<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>syy<\/strong> a fibre; (also) a reason <\/p>\r\n<p><strong>elo <\/strong>life, living<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>In addition to this, we have a couple of nouns and expressions that are even shorter.

<p>Reindeer have always been very important to people in the north. Back in the old days, the ability to co-exist and benefit from the relationship was practically vital to survival. Reindeer provided people with means for transportation, nutrition, material for clothing, and even building. No wonder that a certain craftmanship was built around reindeer-based materials.</p>
<p>Today, reindeer-based products are still used for their traditional purposes. However, these products are also bought by visiting travellers and brought home as gifts; and a new industry has been built around souvenirs and such.</p>
<p>If a whole reindeer skin or a set of trophy antlers sounds like too much, there are plenty of other options available. For instance, beautiful accessories and knife handles are created from discarded antlers. Reindeer drop their antlers every year, thus providing lots of material for skilled craftsmen. You can always ask about the sustainability of the materials used.</p>

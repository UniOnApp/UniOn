<p>Why design a sweetie that&rsquo;s not sweet at all? The taste of <strong>salmiakki</strong> is described as salty liquorice. Keep on eating it as candy, but be aware that it&rsquo;s added to all kinds of products, such as ice cream, vodka, chocolate, or even pizza. Clearly, there must be something deeply cultural behind all this.</p>
<p>Nowadays, <strong>salmiakki</strong> or salty liquorice is considered a typical candy, known only in the Nordic countries, in the Netherlands, and in some parts of Germany. The taste of <strong>salmiakki</strong>, created by adding quite a bit of ammonium chloride in the making, is rather unique &ndash; perhaps too unique for the flavour to catch on in other countries. Finns seem to be born with an appreciation for the taste; although it&rsquo;s also possible to grow accustomed to it, or even love it, later in life!</p>
<p>Some say that the invention of <strong>salmiakki</strong> was more or less a mistake: ammonium chloride was used as medicine, and someone thought of combining it with liquorice. The result cannot have been an instant success, but fortunately it eventually became one. It would be difficult to imagine a Finnish candy store without an extensive section reserved for <strong>salmiakki</strong>.</p>

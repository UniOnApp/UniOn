  "talk": "<p><strong>Are these claims oikein (correct) or v&auml;&auml;rin (incorrect)? You&rsquo;ll know the answers to most questions based on the text about salmiakki &ndash; and maybe you can also guess some! Tap to check.<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<div class=\"ht\">\r\n<p><strong>Salmiakki is not too well known outside Finland.<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p><strong> Oikein. Correct.<\/strong> Salty liquorice is rather common in the Nordic countries, but also in the Netherlands and in parts of Germany. However, Finns seem to enjoy the largest variation of <strong>salmiakki<\/strong> flavours, and we consume by far the biggest amounts of the treat per capita.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<\/div><div class=\"ht\">\r\n<p><strong>Salmiakki is a traditional Christmas dish in Finland.<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p><strong>V&auml;&auml;rin. Incorrect. <\/strong>Even though there have been some sightings of <strong>salmiakki<\/strong> advent calendars, <strong>salmiakki<\/strong> is by no means a Christmas dish. Actually, this might be the one season when even hardcore Finns buy more chocolate than <strong>salmiakki<\/strong>.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<\/div><div class=\"ht\">\r\n<p><strong>The word salmiakki has its origin in the Bible, in the <em>psalms<\/em>.<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p><strong>V&auml;&auml;rin. Incorrect.<\/strong> In archaic Latin, ammonium chloride was called <em>sal ammoniacus<\/em>, which is then only one step away from <strong>salmiakki<\/strong>.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<\/div><div class=\"ht\">\r\n<p><strong>A rhombus, sometimes known as a diamond shape, is often called salmiakkikuvio &ndash; salmiakki shape &ndash; in Finnish.<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Oikein. Correct.<\/strong> The origin of the expression is in one of the traditional forms of <strong>salmiakki<\/strong>. Today, <strong>salmiakki<\/strong> comes in many shapes and sizes, but the expression remains. <\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<\/div><div class=\"ht\">\r\n<p><strong>It&rsquo;s good to eat a lot of salmiakki before kissing someone. This is known as the Finnish kiss.<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p><strong>V&auml;&auml;rin. Incorrect.<\/strong> There&rsquo;s nothing wrong in eating <strong>salmiakki<\/strong> before kissing someone &ndash; but there&rsquo;s no such tradition in Finland. Even some Finns might dislike the taste of <strong>salmiakki<\/strong>, and it would be polite and perhaps wise in general to respect their taste.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<\/div><div class=\"ht\">\r\n<p><strong>Salmiakki tastes good.<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Oikein. Correct.<\/strong> How could it not? To be honest, <strong>salmiakki<\/strong> is an acquired taste, and it might take a while to get used to it. Don&rsquo;t you worry, it&rsquo;s just another reason for you to stay in Finland for a longer period of time!<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<\/div>",

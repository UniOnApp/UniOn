<p>Flea markets and second-hand stores are perfect for finding relatively inexpensive stuff for any materially oriented needs. However, looking for specific items can be very time-consuming, especially if you have absolutely no idea where to start. Also, inexpensive doesn&rsquo;t mean free and sometimes your budget can be temporarily limited.</p><p>No worries, there&rsquo;s always social media! Online communities, such as those aimed at international students of ULapland and Lapland UAS, can point you to the right direction, or even tell you exactly where to find things. Should you need a piece of furniture, a decent bicycle, some dishes, or perhaps a pair of skates, there&rsquo;s more than a fair chance you&rsquo;ll find what you&rsquo;re looking for from your fellow students.</p><p>What&rsquo;s more, some of the discussion groups are even aimed at redistributing used stuff, i.e. at getting rid of things people don&rsquo;t need anymore. For instance, a group called <strong>Roskalava Rovaniemi </strong>is all about donating your stuff to anyone in need &ndash; completely free of charge. Admittedly, many posts are about rather peculiar objects, such as 11 meters of drain pipe, a cuckoo clock missing the cuckoo, or a random collection of pairless shoes; but there are very good discoveries you can make as well!</p>

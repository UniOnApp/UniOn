<p>Looking for charming little shops and boutiques? Start from the centre of the town and work your way to the nearby streets &ndash; as boutiques tend to come and go, it&rsquo;s best to check the situation yourself and repeat the process from time to time.</p>
<p>Most international brands have found their way into the shopping centres <strong>Revontuli</strong>, <strong>Rinteenkulma</strong>, and <strong>Sampokeskus</strong>. Not surprisingly, some of the local boutiques are also conveniently located within these centres, and the caf&eacute;s and restaurants scattered around the centres can make your shopping experience rather pleasant.</p>
<p>For hidden gems, you might have to step outside of the comfort of the shopping centres, though. The traditional way of opening up a small boutique is to find an inexpensive location off the beaten track &ndash; and that&rsquo;s exactly where you&rsquo;ll find the most interesting places. Spend some time wandering around the less busy streets, keep your eyes open, and ask around for hot tips about new boutiques not to be missed!</p>

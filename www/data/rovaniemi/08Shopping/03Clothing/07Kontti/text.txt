<p>Come winter, living in Rovaniemi calls for warm winter clothes. To stock up your closet, go shopping for new winter trends. Take our word for it, long johns and thicker tights are a must!</p>
<p>Perhaps you&rsquo;re in town for a shorter period of time, and don&rsquo;t want to fill your suitcases with tons of winter clothes? Or perhaps you&rsquo;re into supporting sustainability? Not to worry, as there are plenty of second hand options to choose from in Rovaniemi. The selection of second hand winter clothes is rather good and the prices might surprise you positively.</p>
<p>Among many private flea markets, second hand boutiques, and companies providing people with a space to sell their used or semi-used stuff, are some charities, too. For instance, the Finnish Red Cross operates a recycling department store called <strong>Kontti</strong>, a place where the Red Cross sells donated goods, such as clothes, sports equipment, and pieces of furniture. Any income generated by <strong>Kontti</strong> is then used for Red Cross aid work in Finland and abroad. What&rsquo;s more, the Red Cross also sends some of the donated clothes directly to the victims of wars and natural disasters!</p>

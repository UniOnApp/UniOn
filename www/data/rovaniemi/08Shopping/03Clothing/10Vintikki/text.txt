<p>Many second-hand stores in Rovaniemi function on a self-service basis: the company rents tables and spots where people can sell their used stuff. In exchange for a bit of cash, you&rsquo;ll get a space to bring your items to, along with a distinctive sales code to write on the price tags. The space is usually available for a week at a time, after which you need to take away all remaining items. You don&rsquo;t actually have to be around during that week; the company collects all payments at the cash register, and you&rsquo;ll receive a total sum of all purchases made at the end of the week, based on the distinctive sales code.</p>
<p>Easy enough, huh? What&rsquo;s even easier, is the other side of the process. Buying stuff from these flea markets is like buying stuff from any store, albeit way more interesting. You might bump into some rare vintage items, collectibles, or just something that really pleases your taste and is hard to find from regular stores. If you&rsquo;re lucky, the prices might also be rather agreeable &ndash; after all, we&rsquo;re talking about used stuff.</p>

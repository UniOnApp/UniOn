<p>It would be all too easy to assume that Rovaniemi, based on its very northern location, is in the periphery without any proper shops. This assumption, luckily, has been left behind and nowadays people usually assume to find Rovaniemi the way it is: a vibrant town with a delighful range of boutiques and shopping centres for your shopping needs. </p>

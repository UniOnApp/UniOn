<p>One might think that buying ice cream doesn&rsquo;t quite qualify as shopping. Well, it just might, especially if you eat as much ice cream as us Finns. Number one in the world, baby!</p>
<p>The local ice cream factory, Arctic Ice Cream Factory, is a must for any ice cream lover &ndash; and their products are all definitely worth trying! You&rsquo;ll find their products in any well-stocked supermarket, as well as in many caf&eacute;s, bars, and restaurants in Rovaniemi. Also keep your eyes open for their ice cream kiosks and vending trollies in the summertime, in the centre of Rovaniemi!</p>

<p>Our love for coffee has undoubtedly already become clear to you, but perhaps you were unaware that Finns consume one of the highest amounts of milk, too? That&rsquo;s why we think that your first visit to the dairy department could benefit from a bit of pre-knowledge. </p>
<p>Firstly, the vast range of milk and other dairy products available might seem overwhelming. The usual fat percentage varieties are available in all dairy products, and low-lactose and lactose-free choices are considered a basic human right. These varieties are available even in specialities such as <strong>piim&auml;</strong>, <strong>rahka</strong> and <strong>viili</strong>. </p>
<p>Secondly, we consider dairy products an important part of our nutrition as they&rsquo;re seen as a healthy part of a balanced diet. Some dairy products are available as functional foods, too, giving you additional health benefits such as natural protection against infections. These products have been developed in Finnish laboratories specialised in research on functional dairy products and in collaboration with dairy producers such as <strong>Valio</strong>.</p>
<p>Thirdly, you&rsquo;ll be glad to know that the dairy production system is strictly regulated and monitored and that the hygiene system all the way from the farm to the supermarket is &ndash; there&rsquo;s really no humbler way to put it &ndash; top-notch.</p>

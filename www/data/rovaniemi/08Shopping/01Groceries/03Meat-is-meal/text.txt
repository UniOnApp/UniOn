<p>It&rsquo;s not easy to find a traditional butcher shop in Finland nowadays. Most supermarkets have a decent service counter, though, and even pre-packed portions of meat are a pretty good option for a nice meal, at least if carefully prepared and enjoyed with friends and family.</p>
<p>For more serious meat lovers, there are still some options left in Rovaniemi. You can ask around and keep an eye out for seasonal meat products, sometimes directly from the producer. Seasons are especially important if you&rsquo;re interested in trying out top quality game from the region, such as grouse or elk.</p>
<p>A good option for satisfying any meat-related needs is the <strong>Lapin Liha</strong> outlet store, where the local wild food company Polarica offers a wide selection of meat and meat products from all over Lapland. Here you can see huge chunks of reindeer right next to thin slices of elk, all waiting for your innovativeness and taste for a well-balanced and nutritious meal. Ask nicely, and you might receive a well-tested, traditional recipe to accompany your meat purchase.</p>
<p>One of the great things about buying meat in Lapland is the range of ethically, locally, and sustainably produced options available. Many of the meat products available fulfil more than one of these standards, and all of the production and distribution is regulated and monitored extremely well.</p>

<p>Finnish grocery stores are rather similar to the ones found in other countries. Therefore, buying your daily foodstuffs shouldn&rsquo;t be too difficult. To make your life easier, though, we collected a few pieces of advice for your convenience.</p>
<p>1. There are plenty of different grocery stores to choose from in Rovaniemi. Most are run by two or three national chains, and you might also find one or two international grocery store chains here. Not surprisingly, the selection grows with the size of the store, and usually the prices are also lower in bigger supermarkets. Try a few before choosing your favourite.</p>
<p>2. In most stores, you need to weigh the fruit and veggies yourself. Don&rsquo;t worry, you&rsquo;ll learn this soon enough after holding the line at the cash register while running for a price tag for your bananas.</p>
<p>3. In bigger supermarkets, you&rsquo;ll need a queueing number for the fresh meat and fish service counter. Everywhere else there&rsquo;s basically a first-come-first-served policy, based on very limited amount of &ndash; even nonverbal &ndash; communication.</p>
<p>4. Shopping baskets are usually equipped with an alarm. Remember to leave the basket in a stack at the cash register to avoid unnecessary embarrassment at the exit.</p>
<p>5. Plastic bags are available at the register for a small cost. Bring your own bag with you to save the planet, though!</p>
<p>6. The national chain stores have discounts for frequent shoppers. However, some of the chains are based on joint ownership by their customers &ndash; which means that the ownership has to be paid for, and that the discounts might be out of your reach. Ask the staff of your store for their policy.</p>

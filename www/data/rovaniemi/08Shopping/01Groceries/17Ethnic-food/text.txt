<p>Rovaniemi is one of the most international towns in Finland. The tourism industry is booming, and more and more tourists find their way to Rovaniemi &ndash; not only during the Christmas season, but throughout the year. In fact, we&rsquo;re right after Helsinki in international overnight stays in Finland.</p>
<p>The amount of international vistors has left its mark on the restaurant industry of the town. The selection of ethnic restaurants is extensive, and new food cultures are introduced frequently. Therefore it&rsquo;s rather surprising that ethnic grocery stores are a relatively new sight in Rovaniemi; perhaps it was enough to have ethnic food sections in the local supermarkets earlier.</p>
<p>After the first ethnic food store, many others have followed. This has had an effect on the local cuisine, and many families are nowadays stepping out of their comfort zone and trying out new dishes. Perhaps you can add to the possibilities &ndash; we&rsquo;re always willing to learn more!</p>

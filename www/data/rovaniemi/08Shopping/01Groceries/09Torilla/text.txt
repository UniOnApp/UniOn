<p>The season for fruit, vegetables, and berries from Lapland is shamefully short &ndash;after all, everything is covered in snow for the most part of the year. However, a short but intensive summer, along with 24/7 sunlight, adds a ton of flavour to any plant, be it cultivated or hand-picked from the forest. The rich and intensive taste of Lappish potatoes and blueberries is something anticipate.</p>
<p>The best option for your veggie needs is undoubtedly the farmers&rsquo; market, open in summertime from Monday to Saturday. This is the place for seasonal picks; the farmers and producers from all over Lapland bring their finest potatoes, tomatoes, mushrooms, onions, peas, strawberries, blueberries, cloudberries, and lingonberries &ndash; to name a few &ndash; just in time for your summer menu.</p>
<p>Another reason to visit the market place is the unique atmosphere. Wake up early to see some of the locals start their day by enjoying a cup of coffee and a traditional pastry with their fellow residents. The vendors and the customers all seem to know each other, which in a sense might be the case. After all, many vendors have sold their goods at the market since who-knows-when &ndash; just like their customers have bought their favourite potatoes from the same place as long as they can remember. Still, new customers are always welcome!</p>

Tap to check.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<div class=\"ht\">\r\n<p><strong>huovutetut korvakorut<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>Wool, more specifically felted wool.

In this particular case, Lemmenjoki gold has been used to create a unique engagement ring.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"ht\">\r\n<p><strong>koivupuinen tarjotin<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>Wood, more specifically birch. In this case, the tray &ndash; <strong>tarjotin<\/strong> &ndash; is made of birch wood, a particularly typical material for many types of wooden products.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"ht\">\r\n<p><strong>kynttil&auml;lyhty<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>Glass and metal. <strong>Kynttil&auml;lyhty<\/strong> stands for a lantern, and typically has glass embedded in a metal framing.

The bone is usually taken from &ldquo;discarded&rdquo; antlers, since reindeer drop their antlers every year.

<p>Lapland is a perfect place for designers and designers-to-be. The ever-present nature, eight seasons, drastic differences between summer and winter as well as between night and day, and lots of space both geographically and mentally, make up an endless source for inspiration. Combine all this with a long tradition and lots of fresh minds in the Faculty of Art and Design and you have a recipe for exclusive high-quality design products.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll find the best design products from the Arctic Design Shop in the centre of Rovaniemi. The shop has its roots firmly at the University of Lapland, and many of the designers represented in the shop are ULapland alumni. If you want to go shopping for the works of top designers and rising young talents both at the same time, look no further.</p>
<p>Behind all design, there&rsquo;s a story to be found. Part of the charm in arctic design is the strong presence of that story. You can let the design speak for itself, or just ask &ndash; you might even hear the story from the designer herself!</p>

<p>A cosy and warm Lappish home needs a certain number of design elements, such as ceramic tableware, rustic pieces of furniture, moderately scented candles, and decorative cushions. Why not save some time and get all of this from one place?</p>
<p>Pentik is an international interior design retailer, but it has its roots firmly in Lappish soil. Its core expertise is ceramics, from unique decorative pieces to fully functional sets of tableware. Turn your teacup upside down &ndash; after finishing your tea, mind you &ndash; and see if you&rsquo;re actually holding a Pentik cup as we speak. Many do, as the brand has been one of the most likely choices for ceramic tableware in Lapland for decades.</p>
<p>For hardcore fans, a visit to the Pentik factory shop and exhibition is a must. All you need to do is to get a ride to Posio, 135 kilometres from Rovaniemi. With a bit of luck, you might meet some designers, or even the founder and owner herself, Anu Pentik.</p>

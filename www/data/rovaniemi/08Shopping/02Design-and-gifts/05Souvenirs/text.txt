<p>Got friends and relatives expecting you to bring gifts from Finland? Something typically Finnish? You can find some options in the shopping category of this app, but you can also choose the easy way out: Rovaniemi is filled with souvenir shops, and souvenirs are even sold in some of the supermarkets.</p>
<p>A word of warning: some of the souvenirs are very far from the traditional. This is rather understandable, because the traditional materials can be rather expensive, and the process of making them very time-consuming. The relatively high pricing of the traditional handicrafts leaves a lot of room for less expensive, mass-produced copies. This is not to say you shouldn&rsquo;t go for them, but we&rsquo;d just like to ensure you&rsquo;re aware of the background. Actually, some of these mass-produced souvenirs can be very innovative, and might include a witty way of interpreting the traditional approach.</p>
<p>The highest concentration of souvenirs is undoubtedly at the Arctic Circle, in the Santa Claus Village. You can also keep your eyes open in the town centre, or while travelling around Lapland.</p>

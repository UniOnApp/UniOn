<p>What could be a better souvenir or a gift than a pair of mittens knitted by a local grandmother? They&rsquo;re, first of all, genuine handicrafts and, in addition, beautiful and colourful garments. They&rsquo;re lightweight and fit well into your suitcase. They remind you of the arctic, because it&rsquo;s really cold here in winter, and they&rsquo;ll keep you warm!</p>
<p>Knitting is strongly rooted in Finnish culture, and socks and mittens are also really needed in this climate. <strong>Villasukat</strong>, woollen socks, are among the most popular Christmas gifts in Finland.</p>
<p>The Lauri-tuotteet factory shop, situated in a traditional log house, is worth a visit. They have handicraft products, knitted socks and mittens, in their high-quality selection. There are also very beautiful, unique design knives in the shop. In fact, the log house was named after a knife maker called Lauri. Such a massive log house was a typical dwelling by the Kemijoki river from the late 19th century to the Second World War.</p>
<p>The corridors of local shopping centres double as an indoor Christmas market. Well before Christmas, people will set up stalls to sell knitted mittens, beanies, socks, scarfs and other Christmassy handicraft products. Other Christmas markets, both indoor and outdoor, are abound. Keep an eye out for <strong>joulumyyj&auml;iset</strong> or <strong>joulumarkkinat</strong>!</p>

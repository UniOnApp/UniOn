<p>Take almost any field of design &ndash; architecture, furniture, textile and clothing, industrial, or even gaming design &ndash; and you&rsquo;ll be able to find excellent examples of Finnish design. For some, though, nothing is as Finnish as Finnish design glass. Indeed, the list of internationally known Finnish glass designers is quite impressive. Names like Tapio Wirkkala, Timo Sarpaneva, Oiva Toikka, Kaj Franck, Aimo Okkoli, Helena Tynell, Nanny Still and Aino Aalto are familiar to many art glass lovers all over the world. Actually, the iconic Savoy Vase, designed by Aino and Alvar Aalto in 1936, has been described as the best known piece of glassware in the world.</p>
<p>We love our design classics, to say the least, and you&rsquo;ll find certain items from nearly every single Finnish home. Many of the classic pieces are still produced in vast numbers, and the traditional dishware and art glass seems to find an appreciative audience in one generation after another.</p>
<p>When an opportunity to visit a Finnish home comes, keep your eyes open for design glassware. The <strong>Savoy Vase</strong>, also known as the Aalto Vase, is one of the most likely candidates, but you&rsquo;ll soon realise that there are many more to come: the <strong>Mariskooli</strong> bowl, some <strong>Kivi</strong> &ndash; stone &ndash; votives, <strong>Birds</strong> by Oiva Toikka, or perhaps a <strong>Tsaikka</strong> glass to drink your tea from; all from the same design brand <strong>Iittala</strong>.</p>
<p>Finally, remember that it&rsquo;s not important whether your glass is half full or half empty. The importance is in having glass, preferably the design kind!</p>

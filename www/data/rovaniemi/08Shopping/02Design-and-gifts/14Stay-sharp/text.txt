<p>Back in the old days, your survival could very well be at the tip of your knife. In the harsh northern conditions, people made sure to be well equipped before entering the great outdoors. The knife was used as tools to carve wooden dishes, as a means to chop wood or to slice the latest catch, or even as a weapon against predators.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve come a long way from those times, but you might still see some locals with a knife hanging on their belt in public, especially during the fishing and hunting season. This is nothing to worry about, though, as carrying a knife is just a matter of being practical. As a matter of fact, many small children learn how to use a knife as a tool in the northern parts of the country. Therefore, a small knife can even be considered an appropriate gift for a growing kid who&rsquo;s interested in fishing or woodworking.</p>

<p>Speaking of gifts, traditional knives make an excellent gift. Many of the most beautiful knives are practically works of art, and they&rsquo;re made of top-quality materials, such as curly birch and reindeer antler. Don&rsquo;t fall for the cheap plastic ones at the hardware stores &ndash; not the same thing! You can also look for the story behind the knife: in some cases the knife represents years and years of tradition, cultural elements, and even the hand print of the individual knife maker.</p>

<p>In some cultures, giving sharp objects as a gift is considered an insult. This is not the case in Finland, though, which is easy to see when entering the gift shops at the Arctic Circle or Arktikum, for example. If knives are not your cup of tea, perhaps other sharp products, such as axes, scissors, and cheese cutters are your choice from the vast selection of sharp, Finnish products!</p>

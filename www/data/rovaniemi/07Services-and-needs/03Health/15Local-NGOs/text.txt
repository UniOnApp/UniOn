<p>For many Finns, it comes naturally to volunteer for different kinds of projects and organisations. This tradition goes way back to the agrarian past, when working together to achieve common goals, helping your neighbour, and sometimes also asking for help was more or less the only way to survive the harsh conditions of the north.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s no surprise, then, that even today many official services are complemented by third sector ones, provided by numerous non-governmental organisations (NGOs). These organisations have paid personnel, but they also rely heavily on volunteer work. What&rsquo;s great about this is not only the immediate results achieved but also the effects the work has on individuals: more people are involved in important issues, raising awareness and building communities.</p>
<p>A prime example of an NGO is <strong>Tytt&ouml;jen Talo Rovaniemi</strong> (lit. Girls&rsquo; House Rovaniemi), a free activity centre for 12&ndash;28-year-old girls and young women. The centre welcomes anyone to hang out, take part in various activities, and learn about active participation by planning and carrying out activities one finds interesting.

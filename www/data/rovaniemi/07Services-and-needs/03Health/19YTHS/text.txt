<p>Undergraduate students who pay the student union membership fee are entitled to basic health care services of <strong>YTHS (Ylioppilaiden terveydenhoitos&auml;&auml;ti&ouml;)</strong> &ndash; FSHS (Finnish Student Health Service). FSHS provides general, mental and oral health care services, but it doesn&rsquo;t perform extensive medical operations.</p>
<p>If you catch the flu, for example, or have fever or feel otherwise ill, contact the clinic to book an appointment.</p>
<p>Naturally, when you have an appointment, make sure you arrive on time for it. It goes without saying, but we&rsquo;ll say it in any case: please also remember to cancel your appointment if you can&rsquo;t make it.</p>

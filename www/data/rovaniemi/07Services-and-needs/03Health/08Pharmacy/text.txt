<p><span>For your daily pharmaceutical needs, there are several pharmacies in Rovaniemi. It&rsquo;s easy to recognise one from the well-known international logo, but you can also keep your eyes open for the Finnish word for a pharmacy, <strong>apteekki</strong>. Some of the local pharmacies take weekly turns in extended opening hours. However, the opening hours are usually somewhat limited during weekends and public holidays.</span></p>
<p><span>Finnish supermarkets don&rsquo;t sell medicine. Therefore, you should keep some painkillers at hand, at least. You should also know that even in a pharmacy, a prescription is needed for certain medication such as antibiotics, stronger painkillers or birth control pills. Remember that foreign prescriptions, even the ones written in other EU countries, are not automatically valid in Finland. </span></p>
<p><span>The pharmaceutical business is strictly regulated in Finland, and you can rely on the medical products as well as advice at any local pharmacy. Nowadays the pharmacies have extended their selection to cover e.g. natural products, too, although not all of these products work well enough in a case of health problems. However, you can ask for advice at the pharmacy, and get the help you need.</span></p>

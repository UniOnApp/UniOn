<p>Many international students have found their home away from home in Rovaniemi through DAS &ndash; Domus Arctica Foundation. DAS apartments are an excellent choice for several reasons: the location, like-minded neighbours, affordable prices, and a smooth application process, to name a few. However, having more than ten thousand students in town encourages some of the students to check out the options on the private market, too.</p>
<p>Usually, rental apartments are unfurnished in Finland, unless agreed otherwise. Basic home appliances, such as a fridge and a freezer are usually included, though, as are any fixed pieces of furniture, such as integrated window blinds, bathroom and kitchen lights, and integrated cabinets in the kitchen, bedroom and bathroom. Appliances other than the fridge and freezer are included if they&rsquo;re an integral part of the kitchen or bathroom cabinets.</p>
<p>Sometimes the lease includes additional facilities, such as a parking space, or a storage space in the basement or attic. Some buildings also have common facilities available for residents, e.g. a laundry room, a sauna, a place for storing bikes, etc.</p>
<p>As a potential tenant, you should make sure you know what&rsquo;s included in the rent. In many cases, electricity, water, and an internet connection will cost you extra. Furthermore, it&rsquo;s more or less the rule to ask for a deposit, usually it&rsquo;s equal to your monthly rent or sometimes more. Remember to clean the apartment thoroughly at the end before moving out to get the deposit back.</p>
<p>For different types of rental agreements, as well as for quick legal advice, there are several online resources to check. In the end, you&rsquo;re responsible for any contracts and agreements you sign, so it&rsquo;s better to read too much on the topic than to guess.</p>

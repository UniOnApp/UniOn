<p>Ever felt uncomfortable being close to people in an elevator? Think of that particular moment, generalise it to any social setting, and you&rsquo;re on your way to becoming a Finn.</p>
<p>The Finnish concept of personal space is quite unique. First and foremost, some space is required. You might have noticed this in public transportation, while queuing for e.g. tickets or service, or even during university lectures. There seems to be surprisingly long distances even between friends, not to mention total strangers. Violations of personal space cause immediate reactions, such as voiced sighs or grumpy facial expressions, soon followed by a sudden escape to a distant corner of the space so brutally occupied.</p>
<p>What a better place to observe these public demonstrations of personal space than a crowded government office, for instance KELA, the Social Insurance Institution of Finland. You can stir things up a bit by closing the distance between you and your innocent specimen. Avoid touching, though, because it truly is reserved for a very limited selection of one&rsquo;s nearest and dearest only &ndash; and of course for the unavoidable professionals, such as doctors or nurses.</p>

<p><strong>Hupsis!</strong> &ndash; Oops! No sign of your backpack after a night out with friends? Still missing your keys, after going through all your belongings? No worries, the chances are that you&rsquo;ve just misplaced them, and you&rsquo;ll soon be united with your possessions.</p>
<p>After losing your phone or wallet, it&rsquo;s of course best to contact your phone company or your bank &ndash; to give no chance for dishonest individuals. Having done this, it&rsquo;s time to think back and retrace your steps to your belongings. Did you have it when you left home? Did you put it down to unlock your bike? Or perhaps you left it at the coat check of the local pub?</p>
<p>You should first contact the companies and organisations where you might have left your stuff. They usually keep any left-behind possessions for some time. After a period of time they then deliver any lost-and-found stuff to a private company called <strong>Pohjois-Suomen L&ouml;yt&ouml;tavarapalvelu</strong>. The company charges a fee for keeping your belongings and other costs.</p>
<p>Some of the companies take their lost-and-found stuff to the police station. This might also be the case, if your belongings were found by e.g. passers-by. The lost &amp; found service of the local police is free of charge, but there could be a finder&rsquo;s fee to be paid, usually around 10 per cent of the value. If you lost something very valuable this might sting a bit &ndash; but when compared to completely losing the item, it&rsquo;s a small price to pay, after all.</p>

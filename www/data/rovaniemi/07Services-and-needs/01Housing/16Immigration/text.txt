<p>Immigration and integration into the society are often perceived through matters such as learning the local language, finding a job or studying, and making contact with Finns and the society.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s nice to know that there are services available for reaching these goals. The local immigration office, <strong>maahanmuuttajatoimisto</strong>, supports integration and aims to increase equality and understanding among different cultural groups in Rovaniemi. <strong>TE-toimisto</strong>, short for <strong>Ty&ouml;- ja elinkeinotoimisto</strong>, is the Employment and Economic Development Office where specialists are there to help in questions regarding integration and finding work. For students, the University of Lapland, <strong>Lapin yliopisto</strong>, is a wonderful setting for creating networks and becoming part of the local community.</p>
<p>Rovaniemi has always been a place where people from all corners of the globe meet, so we&rsquo;re used to and rather enjoy the international atmosphere of this town!</p>

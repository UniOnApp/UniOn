<p>How can you find out what&rsquo;s going on in Rovaniemi? Most likely, social media is a great source! But what if you&rsquo;d like to plunge into the local life more deeply &ndash; and learn some Finnish on the go?</p>
<p>One good way to do this is to read the local newspaper <strong>Uusi Rovaniemi</strong>, which is delivered free of charge twice a week. The paper has been awarded several times in national competitions that look into the quality of local newspapers in the whole country. So, we can be proud of our local newspaper!</p>
<p>Even though you might not be able to read the newspaper in Finnish, you may still understand something about the content by identifying its sections:</p>
<p><strong>P&auml;&auml;kirjoitussivu </strong>&ndash; the editorial page. This page is dedicated to the editorial, written by the editor of course, and a column written by a changing writer. Can you understand the titles of the editorial and the column?</p>
<p><strong>Mie&amp;Sie </strong>&ndash; me &amp; you. Quite soon after arriving in Rovaniemi, you should know what <strong>mie</strong> and <strong>sie</strong> mean. The words mean <em>me</em> and <em>you</em> in the local dialect. This section contains some of the hot topics of the week &ndash; what locals are talking about at the coffee table this week.</p>
<p><strong>Lukijalta </strong>&ndash; from a reader. <strong>Lukea</strong> means <em>to read</em>, and <strong>lukija</strong> is <em>a reader</em>. Therefore, <strong>lukijalta</strong> means <em>from a reader.</em> This section contains pungent thoughts and often a column by an MP from Lapland.</p>
<p><strong>Ajassa </strong>&ndash; in time. <strong>Aika</strong> is the Finnish word for <em>time</em>. This section contains a lot of articles from Rovaniemi and Lapland. What are people in northern Finland currently interested in and wondering about?</p>
<p><strong>Menoksi</strong> &ndash; let&rsquo;s go. The name comes from the verb <strong>menn&auml; </strong>&ndash; <em>to go</em>. This page has a weekly calendar of events. The list is filled with music events, sporting events, exhibitions, and so on.</p>
<p><strong>P&ouml;rssi </strong>&ndash; the stock market. This section has notifications from readers, such as <strong>halutaan vuokrata </strong>&ndash; <em>rental apartment wanted</em> &ndash; or <strong>vuokrataan </strong>&ndash; <em>for rent</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Hengess&auml; mukana</strong> &ndash; in the spirit. The Rovaniemi parish has a section for a short column by a priest and announcements about religious events. You&rsquo;ll also see who&rsquo;s been <strong>vihitty</strong> &ndash; <em>married</em> &ndash; and <strong>kastettu</strong> &ndash; <em>baptised</em>. This is a great section for getting acquainted with Finnish names.</p>

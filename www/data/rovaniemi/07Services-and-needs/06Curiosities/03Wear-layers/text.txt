<p>Yes, our winters are cold! After all, there&rsquo;s no snow without sub-zero temperatures, and we get a lot of snow. Well, here&rsquo;s a word of solace for you: many international visitors are surprised by the fact that temperatures around -20 degrees centigrade don&rsquo;t feel as cold as they had anticipated. Usually there&rsquo;s not much humidity in the air when it&rsquo;s that cold. So, if you just dress right, you can go out and enjoy the fresh air!</p>
<p>So, what do locals mean by <em>dressing right</em>? The magic word here is <em>layers</em> &ndash; <strong>kerrokset</strong> or <strong>kerrospukeutuminen</strong>. Wear thermal underwear and warm socks, and add a pair of woollen socks if it&rsquo;s below -20 degrees outside. Of course, a pair of well insulated winter shoes may not require woollen socks. Try yours out! Please note that a scarf will also add warmth and comfort to your day.</p>
<p>It goes without saying &ndash; but we&rsquo;ll say it anyway &ndash; that you should also have a good winter coat, trousers with a warm lining inside, a beanie and a pair of insulated gloves.</p>
<p>Get out there and enjoy the day!</p>

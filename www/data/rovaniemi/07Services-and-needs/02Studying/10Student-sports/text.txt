<p><strong>LYY</strong>, short for <strong>Lapin yliopiston</strong> <strong>ylioppilaskunta</strong>, is the student union of the University of Lapland. LYY is there to ensure that the students&rsquo; voice is heard at the university, and it also represents you in decision-making organs outside the university. LYY organises student events, some of which are very sporty, like snow soccer in winter.</p>

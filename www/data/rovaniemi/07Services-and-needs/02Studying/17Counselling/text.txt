<p><span>Does your head feel like a mess sometimes? Not to worry, because you&rsquo;re not alone. </span></p>
<p><span>We all face times in our lives when we may experience that there&rsquo;s too much going on: exams, lectures, essays, all kinds of duties and everything at the same time. A potential culture chock and the Arctic climate may also add to the pile! </span></p>
<p><span>The university provides study counselling for our students. You can have a chat with the study counsellor &ndash; <strong>korkeakouluopintojen ohjaaja </strong>&ndash; if you&rsquo;re having difficulties with things like managing your time, planning and managing your studies, if you suffer from communication anxiety or stage fright, or even if you&rsquo;re feeling lonely or unhappy. Talking with the on-campus professional will most likely lighten your heart! </span></p>

If you catch the flu, for example, or have fever or feel otherwise a bit ill, contact the on-campus <a href="http://www.yths.fi/">YTHS clinic</a> to book an appointment. Please note that the clinic is available to undergraduate students who have paid the student union membership fee.</p>
<p>However, in more serious cases and in cases of emergency, the right place to go to is <strong>LKS</strong> &ndash; <strong>Lapin</strong> <strong>keskussairaala</strong>, the Lapland Central Hospital. It&rsquo;s relieving to know <strong>LKS </strong>has an around-the-clock emergency clinic for sudden injuries and illnesses that require immediate treatment. If needed, help is nearby!</p>

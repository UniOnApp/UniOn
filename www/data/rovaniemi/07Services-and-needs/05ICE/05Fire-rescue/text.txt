<p>Despite our best efforts, things can go wrong &ndash; and it&rsquo;s nice to know there are professionals to help us whenever needed. The main fire department, located conveniently next to the town centre, is on call 24/7, answering to around 1,000 emergency calls or alarms every year. Outside the town centre, the rescue network is completed with five voluntary fire departments.</p>
<p>The general emergency phone number, <strong>h&auml;t&auml;numero</strong>, in Finland is <strong>112</strong>.</p>
<p>The fire crews are always prepared for the worst case scenario, and they spend much of their time in maintaining the equipment, updating their skills, and keeping in good shape. To keep fit, all crew members climb the landmark of the station &ndash; the hose drying tower &ndash; every day. An unofficial record is 150 climbs by one firefighter in one day, which took nearly 5.5 hours to accomplish.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there are also less serious incidents among the alarms. For instance, every winter there are several cases where animals such as reindeer or moose have to be rescued from ice in half-frozen lakes and rivers. And yes, some rescues involve cats stuck in trees, too.</p>
<p>The main fire station is worth seeing also from an architectual point of view. It was designed by a renowned architect Ferdinand Salokangas, known for his valuable input in rebuilding Rovaniemi after WW II. The fire station was constructed in 1949&ndash;1951 and is a prime example of both functionalism and Salokangas&rsquo;s style.</p>

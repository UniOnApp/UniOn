  "talk": "<p>According to some stereotypes, Finns are silent, stubborn, seclusive forest-loving people who don&rsquo;t enjoy small talk situations and dislike the authorities. Finnish literature has a long tradition of such stereotypes being discussed &ndash; and thus strengthened. <strong>Seitsem&auml;n veljest&auml;<\/strong>, the Seven Brothers, (1872) by <strong>Aleksis Kivi<\/strong> was the first novel written in Finnish, and even it discussed the slow adaptation of the seven brothers into civilization; some still regard it as the best Finnish novel ever published.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Another example of iconic literary works is <strong>J&auml;niksen vuosi<\/strong>, the Year of the Hare, (1975) by <strong>Arto Paasilinna<\/strong>. The work has been translated into many languages. It tells about a frustrated journalist. Tired of his work, the journalist is driving his daily commute when he finds a wounded hare. All of a sudden, the journalist decides to escape his frustrating everyday life into the wilderness, together with the hare. The possibility to escape this way seems to fascinate at least the Finnish mindset. <\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>A third interesting addition to this literary tradition is <strong>Jorma Etto&rsquo;s <\/strong>poem <strong>Suomalainen<\/strong>, <em>a Finn<\/em>. Jorma Etto was a poet, journalist and librarian who lived in Rovaniemi and had a significant influece in the culture scene. The street next to the Main Library carries his name: <strong>Jorma Eton tie <\/strong>&ndash; <em>Jorma Etto&rsquo;s street<\/em>. The following poem is one of the best-known, most loved and most quoted texts in Finnish literature. I wonder why?<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Suomalainen<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Suomalainen on sellainen, joka vastaa kun ei kysyt&auml;,<br \/> kysyy kun ei vastata, ei vastaa kun kysyt&auml;&auml;n,<br \/> sellainen, joka eksyy tielt&auml;, huutaa rannalla ja vastarannalla huutaa toinen<\/p>\r\n<p>samanlainen: mets&auml; raikuu, kaikuu, hongat humajavat. <\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Tuolta tulee<\/p>\r\n<p>suomalainen ja &auml;hkyy, on t&auml;ss&auml; ja &auml;hkyy, tuonne menee ja &auml;hkyy, on kuin <\/p>\r\n<p>l&ouml;ylyss&auml; ja &auml;hkyy kun toinen heitt&auml;&auml; kiukaalle vett&auml;.<br \/> Sellaisella suomalaisella on aina kaveri,<br \/> koskaan se ei ole yksin, ja se kaveri on suomalainen.<\/p>\r\n<p><br \/> Eik&auml; suomalaista erota suomalaisesta mik&auml;&auml;n, ei mik&auml;&auml;n paitsi kuolema<\/p>\r\n<p>ja poliisi.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>A Finn <\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p><br \/> A Finn is someone who answers when he is not asked,<br \/> asks when he is not answered, does not answer when he is not asked,<br \/> someone who strays off the road, shouts on the shore<br \/> and on the opposite shore someone else like him shouts:<br \/> the forest rings, resounds, the pine trees sigh.<\/p>\r\n<p>From there a Finn comes and groans, he is here and groans,<br \/> that way he goes and groans, he is like someone in the sauna and groans<br \/> when someone else throws water on the stones.<br \/> Such a Finn always has a chum,<br \/> he is never alone and the chum is a Finn.<\/p>\r\n<p>Nothing can part a Finn from a Finn,<br \/> nothing except death and the police. <br \/> <\/p>\r\n<p>Jorma Etto<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>from&nbsp;Ajastaikaa&nbsp;(Porvoo: S&ouml;derstr&ouml;m, 1964)<br \/> translated by Keith Bosley <\/p>",

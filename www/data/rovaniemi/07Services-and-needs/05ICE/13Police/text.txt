<p>The Police of Finland &ndash; <strong>Suomen poliisi</strong> &ndash; is responsible for general police and law enforcement matters in this country. It&rsquo;s subordinate to the Ministry of the Interior &ndash; <strong>sis&auml;ministeri&ouml;</strong>.</p>
<p>Often police officers patrol in pairs by car, and they&rsquo;re also visible on social media through their virtual police officers, for example. This is because the police is interested in interacting with the public, and having online presence is also part of preventive work. If you wish to follow the local police on Facebook, like their site: <strong>Lapin poliisilaitos</strong>. In addition to patrol cars, the local police officers also patrol by snowmobile in winter; not on roads, though, but on snowmobile routes. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s also a fun fact to know that the Finnish police organises an annual Police Day &ndash; <strong>poliisin</strong> <strong>p&auml;iv&auml;</strong> &ndash; usually at the turn of August and September. Its purpose is to promote local policing, the physical presence of police officers, and &ndash; again &ndash; interaction with people. The event is also an excellent opportunity to ask the police directly about various issues. The local <strong>poliisin p&auml;iv&auml; </strong>is often honoured by Santa Claus and one of his reindeer! </p>

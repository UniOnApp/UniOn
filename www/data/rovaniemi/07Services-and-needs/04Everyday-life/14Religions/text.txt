<p>Finland is a secular country, and religion doesn&rsquo;t usually play a huge role in our daily lives. However, the majority of the population are Lutheran, and Finnish cultural history is strongly rooted in Christianity. For younger generations, religion perhaps plays a less significant role, and the range of religions and beliefs has also expanded during the last decade or two.</p>
<p>The local Lutheran congregation is active also on campus: you&rsquo;ll be able to meet a student chaplain regularly at the university. There are also a variety of activities and events to choose from, many of which are aimed specifically at students.</p>
<p>Speaking of the campus, you&rsquo;ll find an ecumenical space called <strong>Hiljainen huone</strong> &ndash; <em>the quiet room</em> &ndash; right in the middle of the main building. If you&rsquo;re looking for a place to calm down, to say a silent prayer, or perhaps to meditate, look no further. The room is open for anyone, regardless of religion or belief.</p>
<p>Being an international town, Rovaniemi is home to a variety of different religious and spiritual groups and activities. Just follow the flyers, posters, and other ads to the activity of your choice!</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re here on a student exchange for a few months only, you don&rsquo;t necessarily need a Finnish bank account, because ATMs and shops generally accept international debit and credit cards. However, if you start working part-time, for example, the employer may require that you have a bank account in a Finnish bank.</p>
<p>There are many major banks in Finland which also have offices in Rovaniemi but you should notice that all banks don&rsquo;t necessarily provide exactly the same services. In Rovaniemi, you&rsquo;re able to choose at least between these banks: Nordea, OP Pohjola, S-pankki, S&auml;&auml;st&ouml;pankki and Handelsbanken. Ask around and you&rsquo;ll get an idea where there&rsquo;s service available in English, too.</p>
<p>&nbsp;Understandably, banks must identify and know their customers. This means that the bank will verify your identity by examining your official ID card. In addition to your personal data, the bank has a legal obligation to know your need for services, purpose of using the account, financial status and source of funds.</p>
<p>Take with you as much official identification as you can. These are the documents that are mostly required when opening a bank account:</p>
<p>- ID card, generally a passport</p>
<p>- certificate of employment, e.g. job contract (or sometimes a letter of invitation)</p>
<p>- an explanation for why you need a bank account and where the funds are coming from.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no ATM at the University, but there&rsquo;s one next to the K-market Viirinkangas, Viirinkankaantie 19. Naturally, you&rsquo;ll find plenty of ATMs in the town centre, and in all big shopping centres.</p>

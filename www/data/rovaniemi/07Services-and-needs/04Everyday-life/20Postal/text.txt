<p>The main post office in <strong>Revontulikeskus</strong> is a regular post office, with courteous staff members there to help you. Sending parcels abroad is not cheap but the service is considered reliable. You may end up queueing for some time, especially in the weeks before Christmas.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Visiting the post office can turn out to be a cultural plunge. You&rsquo;ll most likely see people standing in line quietly, and some may be fiddling with their smartphones. Sounds boring, but the experience may become upliftingly informative if someone does the odd thing and breaches the unwritten code of conduct. If this happens, consider yourself lucky, because Finns generally don&rsquo;t want to make a scene or draw too much attention to themselves. So, seize the moment, observe what happens, analyse your own emotions, and pay attention to the reactions of others!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are some general attitudes and a loose etiquette about speaking on the phone when on the bus or train, or in other public spaces such as the waiting area of the post office, for example. The general rule of thumb about speaking on the phone is that if it&rsquo;s dangerous or disruptive, you should refrain from doing it. What, exactly, is considered <em>disruptive</em> in this culture then? Well, it depends on the setting. In meetings, seminars and lectures, speaking on the phone is disruptive, downright rude and inappropriate; you&rsquo;ll be frowned upon if you have the nerve to try this. In pubs and restaurants, speaking on the phone is considered irritating but it takes place regardless. If you&rsquo;re at a concert, in the theatre or church and you&rsquo;re talking on the phone there, you&rsquo;re regarded as a barbaric specimen of the human species.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When someone breaches the etiquette, it may look like no one seems to care. In this case, look again and search for subtle cues, as you can rest assured that people have noticed what&rsquo;s going on, and that they probably do care and are annoyed, but they just don&rsquo;t come and tell it to your face &ndash; again, the Finnish way of not making a scene.</p>

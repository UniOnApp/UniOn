<p>As a rule, everyone who works in Finland must have a tax card &ndash; <strong>verokortti</strong>. You can get one at your nearest tax office. The address of the local tax office, <strong>verotoimisto</strong>, is Hallituskatu 3A &ndash; you can see the waiting area in the picture. Before you visit the office, though, find out some information beforehand online at <a href="http://www.vero.fi">www.vero.fi</a>, as different rules apply to non-residents and residents, for example.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re an international exchange student who, for example, works part-time in Finland for a Finnish employer, you should generally pay Finnish tax. If your income is sourced outside Finland, it won&rsquo;t usually be taxed in Finland; the rule is based on international tax treaties between Finland and other countries.</p>
<p>We won&rsquo;t go too deep in advising what to do, because the tax experts are always there to help you &ndash; and they have the latest information!</p>

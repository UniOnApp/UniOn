<p>Finland is well known for its successful rally drivers. Maybe part of the explanation is the driving conditions: driving up and down icy winter roads requires quite a bit of skill and attention.</p>
<p>It’s not very surprising that Finnish Lapland attracts tyre testing professionals, customers of winter driving academies, and owners and builders of new luxury cars enjoying their travel incentives.</p>
<p>There are several things to consider before entering the frozen road network:</p>
<p>1. Winter tyres are compulsory. Finnish legislation requires winter tyres on all cars from 1 December to the end of February. In practice, however, the winter is longer than that in many parts of the country and you’re allowed to keep them on – indeed you have to – until the roads are safe for summer tyres. Due to weather conditions, those of us living in Rovaniemi usually fit winter tyres in mid-October and change back to summer tyres in late April.</p>
<p>2. Snow chains are rarely used in Finland, but all cars must have winter tyres which are studded or so-called traction or friction tyres; the latter type is also known as all-weather tyres. The tread groove of winter tyres has to be deep enough and the pressure correct in each tyre.</p>
<p>3. Engine-block heaters makes it easier to start the car and pre-heating the engine also reduces fuel consumption. It’s common to see drivers plugging their cars into electric sockets in the parking area of their workplace or outside their homes.</p>
<p>4. The road network is ploughed and maintained regularly and with care. However, conditions are known to change quickly.</p>
<p>5. A scraper and a snow brush are a must in every car.</p>
<p>6. Winter days are quite short, especially around Christmas time. Remember to check your lights regularly.</p>
<p>7. Finally, the seemingly empty roads can be surprisingly crowded from time to time: don’t be surprised if you have to share your lane with some furry locals on the go, namely reindeer.</p>

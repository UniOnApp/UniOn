<p>The Japanese karaoke has been warmly welcomed by Finns: it’s popular in bars and – even on the way there! Karaoke taxis are comfortable minibuses with all the necessary equipment for a fun ride. Many songs are in Finnish, but you can enjoy singing to the tunes of some famous hits in English, too. And why not go for a song in Finnish?</p>
<p>Of course, the vast majority of taxis in Rovaniemi are regular ones. The taxi business is highly regulated and they’re very safe and reliable: you can see the price on the meter throughout the drive, and the prices are based on official taxi fares. The prices are a bit higher at night compared to daytime. Card payments are very commonplace and you’re always entitled to the receipt.</p>
<p>Tipping the driver is not necessary and it’s not done very often, but it’s not entirely unusual: you can tip if you’ve been very pleased with the service.</p>
<p>A taxi from Kuntotie to the town centre costs around 15–20 euros.</p>

<p>In northern Finland, public transportation will only take you so far. Considering the long distances, it’s no surprise that most locals own a car. Indeed, if you’re thinking about visiting remote places in the north, such as Kilpisjärvi, Utsjoki, Inari, or even northern Norway, renting a car is usually the most practical solution.</p>
<p>There’s nothing peculiar about renting a car in Finland, really. Just remember to adjust to the local conditions: stay focused while driving in the dark, on ice, or among reindeer.</p>
<p>Also remember to take your favourite CDs with you. In case of a sudden lack of imagination, the Finnish music scene is there to help you. Check out the all-time classics of Finnish road music:</p>

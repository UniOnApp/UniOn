<p>Because Rovaniemi is a fairly small town and distances between places are relatively short, a bicycle is a great option for getting around the town. </p>
<p>There are two or three places in the centre of Rovaniemi where you can buy a second-hand bike for a reasonable price. You can try Tuhat-Tori on Harrikatu or Mountain Bike Center on Ruokasenkatu for a good selection of second-hand bikes.</p>
<p>You should also remember to buy a bicycle light, as well as a bicycle helmet, for your safety. The use of a front light during dark hours is actually required by law, and you can be fined for not using a light.</p>

<p>Cycling is a practical way of getting around in Rovaniemi, but winter conditions bring along their own, unique challenges. </p>
<p>Although the streets are maintained well, sometimes we get heavy snowfalls and then the ploughers have to prioritise the routes they clear from snow first; bike routes come after bigger roads for cars. </p>
<p>When the temperature gets close to 0° Celsius, streets become icy. Again, the streets are maintained and sand is sprinkled on them when this happens, but it’s likely that some parts may not be sanded when you’re cycling to the University early in the morning. </p>
<p>In colder temperatures, around -20° Celsius, the brakes and the gearing of your bike may freeze. If this happens, you may have to walk your bike to some place where you can fix it.</p>
<p>Wear warm gloves and enough layers. A warm hat or a balaclava under your cycling helmet will help you stay warm.</p>

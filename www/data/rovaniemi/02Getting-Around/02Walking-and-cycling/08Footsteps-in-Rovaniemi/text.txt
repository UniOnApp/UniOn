<p>The town plan of Rovaniemi is a curiosity and a piece of art: it was designed by architect Alvar Aalto in the shape of a reindeer head and antlers when Rovaniemi was rebuilt after World War II.</p>
<p>The quirky and charming town plan can make it hard to understand how to find your way at first. Start from the football stadium, it’s the reindeer’s eye in the town plan.</p>
<p>Explore the meandering streets to the tip of the reindeer’s nose and you’ll find the museum and science centre <a href="http://www.arktikum.fi/en/home.html">Arktikum</a> and the <a href="https://www.tiedekeskus-pilke.fi/en/">Science Centre Pilke</a>. Then you’re close to the shore of the river which is also a good place for spotting the northern lights!</p>

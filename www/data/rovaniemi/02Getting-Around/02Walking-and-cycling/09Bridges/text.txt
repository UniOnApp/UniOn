<p>Although Rovaniemi is very large in area, 8 017,19 km² to be exact, the town centre in itself is quite compact, meaning that there’s plenty of peaceful nature around us. The town centre is at the confluence of two rivers: Ounasjoki and Kemijoki.</p>
<p>Often the most practical way to get around the town is by bike or foot. The public transport system does have bus routes that operate continuously, but the buses come only once every 20 or 30 minutes, depending on the line. Holiday periods and weekends bring exceptional timetables: usually some buses are removed from service because kids aren’t taking the bus to school then. Besides, you can enjoy breathing the fresh, clean northern air if you walk or cycle!</p>
<p>If you’re feeling sporty, why not join many locals in walking or cycling by the riverside. We have a name for it: <strong>siltojen lenkki</strong>, meaning the circular route of the bridges. You can start from the town centre, go to Saarenkylä, continue to Pullinranta, and take Jätkänkynttilä – the Lumberjack’s candlelight bridge – or the railway bridge back to the town centre.</p>

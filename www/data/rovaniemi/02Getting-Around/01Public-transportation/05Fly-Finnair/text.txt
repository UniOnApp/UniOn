<p>As you might have noticed, the number of international travellers at the Rovaniemi Airport increases dramatically when the first days of winter season are approaching. Indeed, it’s nearly impossible to find an empty seat in the airport terminal during the busiest days around Christmas.</p>
<p>Today, airports in Lapland are filled with tourists thanks to a record-breaking long tourism season. This has not always been the case, though: it was only in 1984, when the arrival of the first Concorde flight to Rovaniemi brought with it not only travellers but also their needs and wishes for tailor-made services. Much has happened since.</p>
<p>Airports in Lapland have over a million passengers every year. The already familiar charter planes are accompanied by direct international flights to and from several European destinations, such as London and Düsseldorf.</p>
<p>One question still remains: Could the efficiency of the Finnish aviation company Finnair explain the mystery of how Santa Claus is able to reach hundreds of millions of homes in one day?</p>

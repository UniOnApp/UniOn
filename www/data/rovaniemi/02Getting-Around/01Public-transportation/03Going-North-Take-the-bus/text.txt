<p>When you’re planning to travel north from Rovaniemi, taking the bus is the most convenient choice. The train goes to Kemijärvi but not further from there. The bus station, <span style="text-decoration: underline;">linja-autoasema</span> in Finnish, is where you can get on the long-distance buses.</p>
<p>The route is visible at the front of the bus. The long-distance buses operate on various northern routes, such as Kittilä-Levi-Kilpisjärvi-<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tromssa</span>. This route is beautiful, stretching from the western parts of Finnish Lapland all the way to Tromsø, Norway, at the shore of the Arctic Ocean. The scenery along this route is characterised by the silent grace of Nordic fells, forests, pristine nature, small yet active villages. The mountainous shores of Norway are the the icing on the cake!</p>
<p>Another interesting route is Sodankylä-Ivalo-Karasjok-<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Nordkapp</span>. The final destination, Nordkapp, is the Finnish name for North Cape. The route traverses northern wilderness areas including the vast Inarijärvi lake and Nordic fells all the way to the mountains in Norway and the northernmost tip of Europe – North Cape.</p>
<p>You can also take the bus southeast from Rovaniemi. The route Posio-Kuusamo shows you very dense and lusher forests along the Kemijoki river and, as the bus drives on, the riverside scenery changes into serene rolling hills. In Posio, you can visit the beautiful <a href="http://www.arctic-ceramic.fi/en/">Arctic Ceramic Centre</a>, the world’s northernmost ceramics factory, and, the tiny International Coffee Cup Museum, dedicated to coffee culture; something very dear to Finns.</p>
<p>Finally, you can explore the route Ranua-Pudasjärvi-Oulu. It’s an inland route that goes through small villages towards the south and southwest. You can visit the <a href="http://english.ranuazoo.com/">Ranua Wildlife Park</a>: it’s a charming zoo built in the woods, home to a polar bear and 50 other arctic animal species.</p>

<p>For many Finns, home is the focus of social life and Finns generally enjoy being at home. Friends and relatives also visit each other’s homes quite often, to sit down for some coffee and sweet buns in Finnish: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">pulla</span>. When you’re invited to visit your Finnish friend’s home, it’s a sign of friendship and trust.</p>
<p>There are two key things to remember:</p>
<p>1.Punctuality</p>
<p>2.Shoes</p>

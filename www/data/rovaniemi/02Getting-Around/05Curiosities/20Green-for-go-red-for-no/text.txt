<p>For the Finnish mindset, following rules, regulations, and social norms is more or less a must. You might have noticed, for instance, that standing in line comes naturally to a Finn. Not that there’d be an actual punishment for cutting the line, though – just a healthy amount of sighing, frowning, and muted expressions of disapproval.</p>
<p>When it comes to traffic, rules can be slightly bent if it makes things a bit more flexible. However, there are many occasions where rules are obeyed very strictly. For instance, you rarely see Finns crossing the road when the traffic light is red. In fact, if you catch an individual Finn standing in red lights in the middle of the night, with no traffic around, in harsh winter conditions, don’t be alarmed. Instead of an escaped mental patient you just saw a demonstration of respecting the rules!</p>

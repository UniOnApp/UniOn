<p>A warm welcome to Rovaniemi! The first settlers came here around 750–530 B.C. and started clearing land for some agriculture and cultivation. Artifacts found in this region suggest that people arrived here from Karelia in the east, Häme in the south and coastal areas of the Arctic Ocean in the north. The Sámi people, saamelaiset, are Lapland's own indigenous people.</p>
<p>Rovaniemi has grown into an active town with an exotic location at the Arctic Circle. Due to this location, sometimes the town is referred to as the gateway to the Arctic.</p>
<p>The name of the town, Rovaniemi, is a compound noun consisting of two words: rova and niemi. The word ‘rova’ has its roots in the Sámi languages, meaning a high, forested land area. The word ‘niemi’ is an old Finnish word, meaning a headland or ness.</p>
<p>The University of Lapland, based in Rovaniemi, is the northernmost university in Finland and in the European Union. There’s also another higher education institution here: Lapland University of Applied Sciences.</p>

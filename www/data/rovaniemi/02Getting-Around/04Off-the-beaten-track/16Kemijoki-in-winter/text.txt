<p>The frozen Kemijoki river in winter is a place for walking, ice-fishing, snowmobiling, skiing and sledding. On a sunny spring day, many locals head for the river ice to enjoy the day and to get a bit of a tan. Make sure you wear sunglasses because the snow and the sunlight together make the environment very beautiful but also very bright!</p>
<p>Lean-to shelters (in Finnish: <span style="text-decoration: underline;">laavu</span>) are scattered around Rovaniemi and they’re available for anyone to enjoy. Walkers and skiers stop at them to sit by the fire and to eat their packed sandwiches. One lean-to shelter by the river is at Kirkonjyrhämä: it’s close to the church, and the lean-to shelter is known as <strong>Kirkonjyrhämän laavu</strong>.</p>
<p>After January’s very cold temperatures, the ice cover is so thick that even some ice roads are ploughed for crossing the river. Ice so strong is called teräsjää (steel ice).</p>
<p>The river ice may be a new element to you. Enjoy it but be cautious, too. There may be an open area in the ice in places where the current is very strong. Never go near the opening! Here’s why: the ice around the opening is being eroded by the current and it can be very thin, meaning that the ice may not be able to carry you.</p>

<p>Rovaniemi is a great place to live in if you enjoy the great outdoors. There are hundreds of kilometres of well-groomed cross-country ski trails in Rovaniemi, and you can get to them by foot or sometimes even on skis from your doorstep.</p>
<p>Ounasvaara is one of the best places to try cross-country skiing, because all ski trails are suited for both classic and skate style.</p>
<p>There’s a bit of an etiquette to keep in mind: please never walk on the ski trails, because footprints ruin the pleasure of a well-groomed trail! If you prefer walking, there are winter walking routes around Ounasvaara as well.</p>
<p>The Ounasvaara ski trails are colour-coded in the maps according to their level of difficulty:</p>
<p><strong>helppo latu</strong> easy ski track (marked in blue)</p>
<p><strong>keskivaikea latu</strong> moderately difficult ski trail (red)</p>
<p><strong>vaikea latu</strong> difficult ski trail (black)</p>
<p>The Finnish skiing culture has some interesting characteristics. The fresh air and the spring sunshine, combined with the activity of skiing, make people more sociable than usual. You may get a joyful <strong>Hei!</strong> and a smile when you meet other skiers on the tracks.</p>
<p>Along the ski trails, there are places where you can stop for a while. The word for these lean-to shelters is <span style="text-decoration: underline;">laavu</span> in Finnish. There’s a fireplace and some firewood available for your use at the laavu. A laavu is where you can get to know Finns on a sunny day in spring when people of all ages hit the tracks and stop there to fry sausages, drink coffee and to chit-chat.</p>
<p>Life really feels good on such a day! Pack some sandwiches, sausages and a thermos flask of something hot to drink in your backpack. Smile and greet people and you’ll feel like a true Laplander!</p>

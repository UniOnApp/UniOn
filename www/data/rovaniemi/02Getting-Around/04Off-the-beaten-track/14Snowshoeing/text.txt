<p><strong>“Tietä käyden tien on vanki.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Vapaa on vain umpihanki.”</strong></p>

<p>Finns love the mentality of this poem and often refer to it.</p>
<p>Snowshoes have been the equipment of choice for Finnish lumberjacks, border guards and hunters for more than a century. Even with all the new technologies available, reaching remote destinations and difficult locations is still easiest with two paddle-like extensions for shoes, and a bit of muscle work.</p>
<p>Snowshoeing is a very popular winter sport and a great way of spending some idle time in the wilderness. Grab a pair, and head for the nearest forest. Make sure you fill your backpack with some hot glögi and a sandwich or two. In case you don’t own a pair of snowshoes, renting them is always a possibility!</p>

<p>The Kemijoki river is the longest river in Finland. It’s about 550 km long, stretching from the streams and marshes of Korvatunturi in Eastern Lapland – the home of Santa Claus according some Finnish folklore. As the wild river flows downstream, other rivers join it, making the Kemijoki river impressively vast. It travels through Kemijärvi and Rovaniemi until it reaches the Gulf of Bothnia in the Kemi region.</p>
<p>The history of the Kemijoki river is characterised by its significance as an ancient thoroughfare and salmon river. Before any hydroelectric power plants were built along it, the Kemijoki river was one of the best salmon rivers in Europe: as much as 160 tonnes of wild northern salmon was caught annually. The building of hydroelectric power plants began in 1946 and today Kemijoki has been harnessed to produce electricity through 21 power plants.</p>
<p>There are many things that make Rovaniemi unique, and one of them is that it’s located at the confluence of two major rivers in Lapland: the Kemijoki and Ounasjoki rivers. The Ounasjoki river is still wild all the way through.</p>
<p>Locals love their river. Every spring, the ice break-up is quite a spectacle with the ice plates crashing and the river flooding. This is the time when we know that summer is arriving.</p>
<p>Summer is short and very intense. There’s light 24/7 and people make the most of it by swimming, fishing, boating, and spending time at summer cottages. The river is present in these activities. There’s even a sauna raft in Rovaniemi that operates on the river.</p>
<p>The most popular beaches are the Ounaskoski beach near the Lumberjack’s Candlelight Bridge and the Ounaspaviljonki beach in Saarenkylä near Citymarket. Please be aware, though, that the current in our vast river is very strong – don’t go swimming right next to the bridges. Observe the areas where the locals swim and ask someone if you’re unsure.</p>

<p>Thanks to our long winters, the summer golfing season in Rovaniemi is relatively short. However, once the local golf club, Santa Claus Golf, opened its 18-hole course for the season, it has been possible to play practically around the clock under the Midnight Sun &ndash; making the most of our summer! The fun doesn&rsquo;t end there, though: the club offers a unique opportunity to play winter golf on its 9-hole winter course!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In addition to traditional golf, a distant cousin of the sport, frisbee golf, has gained ground in Rovaniemi for quite some time. One might argue that using plastic discs instead of small balls is more than stretching the rules of the prestigious game. This might be true, but it&rsquo;s difficult to argue with popularity &ndash; and judging by the number of players, frisbee golf is here to stay. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are several frisbee golf courses in Rovaniemi, and at least three of them can be easily reached from the town centre. The most popular courses include a 9-hole course at SantaSport, an 18-hole course on the other side of Ounasvaara, and a 20-hole course in Toramo &ndash; about five kilometres from Kuntotie. Keep an eye out for new locations, as both serious games and friendly hanging-around evenings with outdoorsy people are waiting for you! You can of course contact the local frisbee golf association, Rolffarit, for more details.</p>

<p>SantaSport is an oasis for sports enthusiasts! There&rsquo;s a spa section and a 25-metre-long swimming pool, bowling alley, gym, indoor running tracks, aerobics and other classes, a climbing wall &ndash; you name it. In the summertime, the outdoor adventure park Huima is a place for climbing and zip-lining yourself from tree to tree. The challenges don&rsquo;t end there, though: also other types of obstacles are there to be navigated by the outdoorsy and adventurous!</p>
<p>The bowling alley has become popular among students. For example, on Fridays and Saturdays, you can put on a white outfit and try <strong>hohtokeilaus</strong>, space bowling, with your friends and see who glows the most! There&rsquo;s also a small restaurant at the bowling alley.</p>
<p>Since it&rsquo;s a sports institute, sporting events often take place in the premises. To give an example, the Rovaniemi volleyball teams that are playing at the highest league level in Finland play their matches there.</p>
<p>You can also rent a variety of sports equipment, including mountain bikes, fatbikes, skis, snowshoes, frisbee golf gear, and so on. When the darkness of the polar night gets to you in the winter, fight back! Don&rsquo;t take a nap on the couch, but instead get your act together by doing something sporty with a bunch of your friends! </p>

<p>Rovaniemi has great winter sports opportunities, and there&rsquo;s no reason why you shouldn&rsquo;t make the most of them. But before hitting the skiing trails or ice-skating rink, pay attention to your clothing.</p>
<p>Wearing a beanie, <strong>pipo</strong>, is a must most of the winter and layers, <strong>kerrokset</strong>, will often get you through any weather. A pair of solid gloves, <strong>hanskat</strong>, or mittens, <strong>lapaset</strong>, will ensure your fingers stay warm. You&rsquo;ll find the right kind of clothing for different sports by asking others and experimenting yourself. The clothing doesn&rsquo;t depend on type of sport only, but also on the &ndash; often changing &ndash; weather conditions. Wearing warm shoes, <strong>keng&auml;t</strong>, is also essential. Sneakers in winter are not an advisable option!</p>
<p>For cross-country skiing, it&rsquo;s often enough to wear a warm layer under your coat, <strong>takki</strong>, and skiing trousers, <strong>hiihtohousut</strong>, because skiing as a sport is quite intense. On the other hand, if you&rsquo;re trying it out for the first time in your life, it&rsquo;s wise to wear something warmer: if you don&rsquo;t master the technique yet, you may first just get to know the basics and not cover more than 100 metres in distance.</p>
<p>Be it skiing, skating, snowshoeing, or even ice-fishing you&rsquo;re trying out, wearing the right kind of clothing is a requirement for an enjoyable experience. Otherwise doing winter sports may just become a frustrating experience.</p>
<p>We have a saying <strong>Ei ole olemassa huonoa s&auml;&auml;t&auml;, vain huonoja vaatteita. </strong>It means: <em>There&rsquo;s no such thing as poor weather, only poor clothing. </em>Well, that&rsquo;s the spirit!</p>

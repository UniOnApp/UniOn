<p>Perhaps due to our long distances between cities, Finland is well known for endurance games. Finnish athletes dominated the 5K and 10K runs before WWII, and cross-country skiing wouldn&rsquo;t be the same without its Finnish contribution. Indeed, most Finns have enjoyed this legacy in elementary school &ndash; and we all have fond memories of physical exercise classes spent covering long distances on foot or on a pair of skis!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fond memories aside, what could be a better way to spend a sunny, summery day than going for a run with your friends, or perhaps participating in a running event? Pacing through scenic landscapes with a bunch of like-minded friends is the perfect way to counterbalance the buzzing life at the university.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s plenty to choose from: Finland is full of different kinds of running events practically around the year. See the true Lappish landscape by taking part in Ruskamaraton in Levi in early September, check out the annual ultra run in Kuusamo in May, or choose the local race, the Rovaniemi Marathon, at the turn of June and July. All these events have lots to offer: breathtaking scenery, international atmosphere, and even the occasional glimpse of the most famous Finnish athlete, Santa Claus!</p>

<p>Rovaniemi is the capital of Christmas, so why not spend the holidays by experiencing some of the beloved Finnish Christmas traditions? Follow this list for a truly Finnish Christmas experience!</p>
<p><strong>1. Christmas carols</strong></p>
<p>Come Christmas time, many radio stations turn into seriously Christmassy mood. Traditional Christmas songs are serious and solemn, but modern tunes often have more jazz in them. Get a teaser at the Arctic Circle, where it&rsquo;s Christmas all year round!</p>
<p>In December, the local parish organises open events that anyone can join and sing some all-time-favourite Christmas carols. Keep your eyes open for them: <strong>Kauneimmat joululaulut</strong>! It&rsquo;s not customary for Finns to go around carolling, so this might be the closest you can get to a social singing event.</p>
<p><strong>2. Shopping spree</strong></p>
<p>Shopping malls are full of frantic shoppers before Christmas. You don&rsquo;t have to follow them in their frenzy, but you should definitely secure some basic Christmas food items before the shops run out of them. <strong>Joulukinkku</strong>, or Christmas ham, is the traditional centrepiece of the dinner table. It&rsquo;s often accompanied by <strong>porkkanalaatikko</strong>, carrot casserole, <strong>lanttulaatikko</strong>, sweet turnip casserole, and <strong>rosolli</strong>, Finnish beetroot salad. For dessert, try <strong>gl&ouml;gi</strong>, sweet mulled wine and often non-alcoholic, with some <strong>pipari</strong> and <strong>torttu</strong>, a gingerbread cookie and a typical plum-filled star-shaped pastry.</p>
<p><strong>3. Preparing your home for Christmas</strong></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s customary to have a complete around-the-house cleaning spree in every home before Christmas. This is followed by a semi-nutty decoration operation, complete with glittery ornaments, red cardboard-cut-out elves, and naturally &ndash; <em>Ta-da!</em> &ndash; the Christmas tree. Remember to play those Christmas hits while cleaning your place!</p>
<p><strong>4. Slowing down, tuning in</strong></p>
<p>Christmas is really about spending time with your loved ones and stepping out of the rat race, not about tons of gifts, right? Our Christmas used to be just like this, and many still believe that one should not make too much noise or fuss around Christmas. You can follow the Declaration of Christmas Peace, <strong>joulurauhan julistus </strong>&ndash; in Turku, broadcast live on Christmas Eve to calm yourself down, and to make room in your heart for the real Christmas.</p>
<p><strong>5. Having it all (maxing it out?)</strong></p>
<p>In case you&rsquo;re planning to try out even the most hard-core traditions, prepare yourself for a visit to the local cemetery, where most Finns visit their loved ones&rsquo; graves on Christmas Eve. This can be integrated in a traditional sled ride if you manage to find a sled and a horse for the purpose. After an exhausting Christmas Eve with your family and friends, you should wake up for the Christmas Day mass at the local church, traditionally held around six or seven in the morning&hellip;</p>
<p>&hellip; or you can choose the modern way: exchange gifts with or without Santa, have a good time, eat just a bit too much, and sleep in!</p>

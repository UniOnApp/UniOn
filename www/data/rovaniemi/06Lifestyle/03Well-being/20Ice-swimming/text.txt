<p>Swimming is great fun &ndash; especially when you can do it outdoors, in natural waters. Admittedly, you might have to work your way through an ice cover, sometimes even a thick one, in winter. Fortunately, some nice people do maintain specific places for those in the need of a thrilling adrenaline rush!</p>
<p><strong>Avantouinti</strong>, literally a-hole-in-the-ice-swimming, or ice swimming, is a rather popular pastime in Finland. Many people swear that the sport keeps them healthy and energised, or even completely free from minor health issues. It&rsquo;s not a rare sight to spot early swimmers at the local ice swimming facility, re-charging their batteries for a long day at work.</p>
<p>Active ice swimmers have reported numerous health benefits ranging from reduced stress levels to more balanced mood, and from better memory function to less pain caused by some chronic conditions, such as fibromyalgia or asthma. There is even some scientific evidence to these claims. However, a word of an advice is in order to prevent any problems.</p>
<p>Dipping in ice cold water is not dangerous for a healthy person. Having said this, people with e.g. heart disease should think twice before taking any unnecessary risks in extreme conditions. Furthermore, one should never go ice swimming under the influence of alcohol! You can also prevent any risks by wearing neoprene socks or sneakers, a warm cap, and even gloves.</p>
<p>Ice swimming is definitely worth trying! There are official holes-in-the-ice, <strong>avanto</strong>, all over Lapland, usually maintained by sports clubs and other organisations; ask around for instructions and good company. And should you fall in love with the sport, there are even ice swimming competitions every year!</p>

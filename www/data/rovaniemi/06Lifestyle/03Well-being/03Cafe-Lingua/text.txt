<p>Caf&eacute; Lingua is a meeting point for people interested in languages and cultures in a trendy caf&eacute;, Hostel Caf&eacute; Koti, right in the town centre. The casual atmosphere of Caf&eacute; Lingua allows people to chitchat in Chinese, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Russian, Scandinavian languages, Spanish and of course, Finnish and English, while enjoying a nice cup of coffee.</p>
<p>The gatherings are informal, and each language group is hosted by a native speaker of that language. Every second week the English language group offers a theme from culture to board games to music and poetry. Caf&eacute; Lingua is an excellent place to make international friends and grow your network!</p>

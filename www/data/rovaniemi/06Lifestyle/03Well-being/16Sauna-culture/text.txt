<p>No question about it &ndash; the sauna is truly very meaningful for most Finns!</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ve probably noticed that there&rsquo;s a sauna in almost every house in Finland &ndash; even many apartments are equipped with one. The official number of saunas in Finland is above two million, but some estimates go as far as 3.2 million saunas. It&rsquo;s safe to say that having access to a sauna is seen as a basic human right!</p>
<p>Any Finn will let you know &ndash; whether you want it or not &ndash; that the proper sauna is a Finnish invention. This statement is usually followed by an exceptionally long monologue, complete with a list of studies that prove countless health benefits linked to bathing in an authentic sauna. Naturally, accepting all this is the easy way out, although it might lead into yet another go at this great Finnish invention!</p>
<p>Trying out different kinds of saunas is actually part of the fun. Finns have made it their life-long task to design and build saunas wherever possible. There are saunas in remote cabins and in places of business; saunas floating on lakes and mobile saunas on frozen lakes; saunas you can trail behind your car, boat, motorcycle, or bike; saunas in tents, barrels, and even igloos. The Finnish parliament building in Helsinki has a sauna, and Finnish embassies around the world typically have very elegant saunas. So, they come in all shapes, sizes, and types! There are even several types of traditional saunas around.</p>
<p>Becoming a sauna master begins with the first step! All you have to do &ndash; after finding a suitable sauna &ndash; is to follow some basic guidelines. Here&rsquo;s a list to get you started!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>1. Take your time</p>
<p>To thoroughly enjoy a sauna bath, you need to take it slowly. The sauna is as much a state of mind as it&rsquo;s a place to be in. The process has to be relaxed and natural, not a rush-through.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>2. Respect the sauna</p>
<p>There should be no shouting or screaming in the sauna. For centuries, the sauna was considered downright sacred, and even today there&rsquo;s a certain level of respect in the way most Finns treat their saunas.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>3. Respect the others</p>
<p>When bathing with others, it&rsquo;s polite to ask before throwing water on the stove. Filling the bucket when leaving the sauna is advisable, too. Discussions are absolutely fine, even heated ones &ndash; as long as you don&rsquo;t raise your voice too much!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>4. Water + sauna = well-being</p>
<p>Remember to keep yourself hydrated (drink some water!), and wash yourself well <em>both before and</em> <em>after</em>. Cold beer is admittedly a tasty choice to have while in the sauna, but you should limit your drinking to one or two beers only. Getting drunk would not only violate the code of conduct, but it would also undo any health benefits, or even cause new problems.</p>

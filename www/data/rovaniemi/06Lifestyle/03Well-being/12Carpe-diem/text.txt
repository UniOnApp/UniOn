<p>Seizing the moment is also part of the lifestyle at these latitudes, especially in the summertime. Why? Well, let&rsquo;s face it, the local climate is somewhat unpredictable in summer: sometimes we&rsquo;re very lucky with the weather pattern and bask in 25 degrees centigrade or even above. On other occasions, we may very well be less lucky and end up having rainy days and temperatures around 10 degrees. You can never really tell for sure what the next summer will be like. </p>
<p>So, if you&rsquo;re here in summer, be advised: if it&rsquo;s a nice day outside, it&rsquo;s worth making the most of &ndash; carpe diem! <strong>Tartu hetkeen!</strong></p>

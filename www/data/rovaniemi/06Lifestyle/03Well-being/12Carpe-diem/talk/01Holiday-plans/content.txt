  "talk": "<p>As summers are short in Lapland, the summer holiday means a lot to us. We try to make the most of it. Summer holidays are usually planned throughout the long winter, and plans are also discussed at coffee tables abundantly.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>In Finland, the most important holiday month is July. Sometimes it feels that the whole of Finland is closed in July because everyone&rsquo;s on holiday. Finns are fishing in the wilderness, travelling to quirky festivals, or just enjoying several sauna baths a week at their cottages.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>In the autumn, as work and school begin again, we discuss what we did on holiday. Usually somebody says that the weather has been terrible. And another one complains that there were a lot of mosquitoes at the cabin. Or the sun was shining all night long and it was difficult to sleep. Somebody became so home-sick while travelling that the whole family returned home after one night. The misfortune was so overwhelming that there&rsquo;s enough to talk about all winter!<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>Now, look at the following dialogues. The first is in the present tense, focusing on the holiday plan. In Finnish, the present tense can also be used to refer to the future. The latter is in the past tense, focusing on how everything actually went!<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>You can find that the letter <span style=\"background-color: #99ccff;\">i<\/span> is the past tense marker. Sometimes i replaces another letter and sometimes it&rsquo;s added there. Sometimes there appears a combination of <span style=\"background-color: #99ccff;\">&ndash;si<\/span> or <span style=\"background-color: #99ccff;\">&ndash;oi<\/span>, as well. This is due to different verb types. You can easily find more information about <em>Finnish verb types<\/em> and past tense forms online if you&rsquo;re interested in exploring them in more detail.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Lomasuunnitelma (Holiday plan)<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>- Kuule, mit&auml; te teette lomalla?<\/p>\r\n<p>No, me menemme Inarij&auml;rvelle. Me kalastamme kaksi viikkoa. S&auml;&auml; on hein&auml;kuussa yleens&auml; hyv&auml; siell&auml;, aika harvoin sataa vett&auml;.&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>- Mit&auml; muuta te teette?<\/p>\r\n<p>Me k&auml;ymme Siida-museossa ja tapaamme sitten sukulaisia. Me varmaan puhumme paljon. Matti haluaa jutella serkkujensa kanssa. Ihanaa, ett&auml; loma alkaa pian! Onneksi aikaa on paljon, loma loppuu vasta parin viikon kuluttua!<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>- Listen, what are you going to do on holiday?<\/p>\r\n<p>Well, we&rsquo;ll go to Lake Inari. We&rsquo;ll be fishing there for two weeks. The weather in July is usually good there, it rains quite rarely.<\/p>\r\n<p>- What else are you going to do?<\/p>\r\n<p>We&rsquo;ll go to the Siida Museum and then meet relatives. We&rsquo;ll probably talk a lot. Matti wants to chat with his cousins. It&rsquo;s wonderful that the holiday will start soon! Fortunately, there&rsquo;s a lot of time, the holiday will end only in a couple of weeks!<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Loman j&auml;lkeen (After the holiday)<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p>-Mit&auml; te <em>te<\/em><span style=\"background-color: #99ccff;\"><em>i<\/em><\/span><em>tte<\/em> lomalla?<\/p>\r\n<p>Me <em>men<\/em><span style=\"background-color: #99ccff;\"><em>i<\/em><\/span><em>mme<\/em> Inarij&auml;rvelle.

We spent two days fishing. The weather was terrible. It was raining and it was really cold. We didn&rsquo;t visit the Siida Museum because it was closed on Monday. Then we met relatives. We talked only for a moment and then Matti wanted to go back home. It feels that the holiday ended just when it started!<\/p>\r\n<p>- Well, fortunately, there&rsquo;s going to be a holiday again next summer!<\/p>",

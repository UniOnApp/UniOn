<p>Have you noticed that there are board games available in many local pubs? The Main Library is also a wonderful source of well-being, as you can get board games there for home-loan, free of charge.</p>
<p>Maybe it&rsquo;s because of the cold climate, but we do enjoy sitting down together for a nice game of Monopoly, for example &ndash; or <strong>Monopoli</strong>, as we call it in Finnish. It&rsquo;s not such a bad idea either, since having a good time with people you enjoy being with is certainly good for your well-being &ndash; you can feel it.</p>
<p>Gather a group of friends and head for the local pubs for a night of board games! Or throw a small party at home, with selected board games from the library &ndash; just don&rsquo;t spill anything on the board!</p>

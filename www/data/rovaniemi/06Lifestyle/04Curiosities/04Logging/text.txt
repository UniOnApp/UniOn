<p>Trees and forests are present everywhere in Finland, and it&rsquo;s easy to spot traces of forest-related activities anywhere you go. As Rovaniemi, too, has its past &ndash; and present in some respect &ndash; deeply rooted in lumber, our modern cityscape offers many glimpses of the industry.</p>
<p>As suggested in section <em>Worth seeing </em>of this app, you can visit the <strong>Pilke</strong> science centre for a formal approach to the subject, or perhaps meet and greet the iconic statue of Mr. Lumberjack to ask his opinion. There are plenty of other options, some of which are seriously academic, and others, well, less so.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>1. Timber haulage yard</strong></p>
<p>Finland is considered to be one of the best areas in the world for tree growth. Furthermore, the Finnish wood industry is built on solid, sustainable forestry, and the total volume of trees in Finnish forests is increasing every year despite significant use of lumber.</p>
<p>One of the most visible reminders of the industry is the timber haulage yard near the railway station and only a stone&rsquo;s throw away from the hypermarket Prisma. Seemingly endless piles of tree trunks are hauled there from the woods by a fleet of trucks, to be loaded onto trains and hauled off to different factories and facilities around the country. Despite the impressive amount of wood at the yard, it represents only a tiny fraction of the timber processed annually by the industry altogether.</p>

<p><strong>2. Landmark pubs</strong></p>
<p>A more subtle reminder of the logging profession is very much visible in the names of some local pubs and bars. Some of them have actually made a point of paying homage to the industry by painting a whole story of the old logging days to their customers. For instance, <strong>Pub Uitto</strong> &ndash; or Pub Rafting &ndash; is more or less all about the old days of logging glory. Another reference to the past lies in the name of <strong>Koskikapakki</strong> &ndash; the Rapids Joint &ndash; in <strong>Koskikatu</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>3. Koskenlasku &ndash; white water rafting</strong></p>
<p>Speaking of Koskikatu, there&rsquo;s also a tradition among academics connected with logging. This tradition is called <strong>koskenlasku</strong> or white water rafting, and the idea is to go through all (or most, there are a&rsquo;plenty) bars along the street Koskikatu, and down a pint in each. It&rsquo;s kind of homage to the old days&rsquo; logging tradition at large, but it usually ends up bringing a specific part of the tradition to life: hordes of lumberjacks hitting the bars of Rovaniemi to spend their hard-earned salaries on beer and booze.&nbsp;</p>

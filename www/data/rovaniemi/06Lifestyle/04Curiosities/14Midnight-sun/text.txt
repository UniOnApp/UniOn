<p>As a natural phenomenon, the midnight sun &ndash; <strong>keskiy&ouml;n</strong> <strong>aurinko</strong> &ndash; is the opposite of the polar night &ndash; <strong>kaamos</strong>: the sun is above the horizon 24/7. In Rovaniemi, the period lasts for one month, approximately, from early June to early July. The further north you go, the longer the period of the midnight sun is. At the northernmost point of Finland, the period lasts for some 60 days. </p>
<p>It&rsquo;s an often forgotten and even understated fact that circa 1/4 of the surface area of Finland is north of the Arctic Circle, and, therefore, such an impressive proportion of this country is in this magical zone.</p>
<p>This time of the year has a special place in people&rsquo;s hearts. We celebrate it by having late-night BBQ parties at home, or going out for a picnic in the wee hours, dancing in outdoor dance pavilions &ndash; <strong>lavatanssit</strong> &ndash; just to give some examples. </p>
<p>If you decide to stay here after the academic year is over, be aware that some visitors and newcomers experience <em>hypomania </em>&ndash; it&rsquo;s nothing dangerous, only an unusually elevated mood! </p>

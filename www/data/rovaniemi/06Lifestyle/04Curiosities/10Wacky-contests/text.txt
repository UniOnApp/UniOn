<p>Did you think it isn&rsquo;t possible to compete in mobile phone throwing? Sure it is! Or sitting in an ant hill, wearing absolutely nothing? Think again! </p>

<p>These contests have long been part of the summer lifestyle here:</p>
<ul>
<li>Air-tango dancing</li>
<li>Berry picking </li>
<li>Dance pavilion tango</li>
<li>Mobile phone throwing</li>
<li>Sitting in an ant hill</li>
<li>Summer &rdquo;ice&rdquo;-fishing</li>
<li>Swamp soccer</li>
<li>Sweet-talking to your dog</li>
<li>Welly-wanging</li>
<li>Wife-carrying</li>
</ul>

<p>As you can see, we embrace summer to the fullest by not taking ourselves too seriously! Join the games!</p>

<p>The same wackiness follows in winter, although not as extensively: snow soccer and official snowball fighting contests are part of the picture.</p>

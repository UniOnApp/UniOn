<p>The local lifestyle is also characterised by design. After all, the impressive Faculty of Art and Design has a solid status in the local everyday life through its numerous events and exhibitions. There&rsquo;s always something new going on in <strong>taiteiden tiedekunta</strong>!</p>
<p>The history of design in our way of life is rooted further back in history, though. Certain post-war buildings scattered around Rovaniemi represent the creativity of architects <strong>Alvar Aalto </strong>and <strong>Ferdinand Salokangas</strong> &ndash; both produced a significant amount of work in the post-war reconstruction of this town.</p>
<p><strong>Maison Aho </strong>is a private home in <strong>Pohjolankatu</strong>, and it was designed by Alvar Aalto in the early 1960s. The floor plan of the house is slightly fan-shaped, as is sometimes typical in Aalto&rsquo;s designs. Unfortunately, there&rsquo;s no access to this private home, and it can look surprisingly modest from the street. The interior is said to be both cosy and festive, and Aalto designed it for a family with a private collection of art, so there&rsquo;s more than meets the eye!</p>
<p>Aalto&rsquo;s designs are present in Finnish homes in the form of the Savoy Vase, more informally known as the Aalto Vase. This piece of glassware was created by Alvar Aalto and his wife Aino, and it became so iconic that almost every Finnish home has an Aalto Vase &ndash; <strong>Aalto-maljakko</strong>.</p>
<p>The building that houses the Arctic Light Hotel in <strong>Valtakatu</strong> was designed by Ferdinand Salokangas. You can see his trademark ornamental style, in the balconies decorated with stars. The local fire station, <strong>paloasema</strong>, located in <strong>Koskikatu</strong>, was also designed by Ferdinand Salokangas. Naturally, these are only a couple of examples of his designs, to give you an idea of his style.</p>

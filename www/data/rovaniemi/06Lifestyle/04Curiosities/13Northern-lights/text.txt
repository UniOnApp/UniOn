<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of mystique and folklore connected to the northern lights &ndash; <strong>revontulet</strong>. This mystical phenomenon is part of the local lifestyle, too.</p>
<p>The northern lights are, concretely speaking, collisions of energetically charged particles with atoms high up in the atmosphere, more specifically in a layer called the thermosphere. The energetically charged particles are drawn by the Earth's magnetic field into the atmosphere, and that&rsquo;s why we have the Aurora Borealis in the northern hemisphere, and &ndash; correspondingly &ndash; the southern hemisphere is home to the Aurora Australis.</p>
<p>According to statistics, you can see the northern lights in Rovaniemi every third clear night from October to March &ndash; rather frequently. Maybe that&rsquo;s why locals don&rsquo;t make a fuss about them either &ndash; seeing them blazing in the sky is part of everyday life. We do enjoy seeing them, of course, but rarely go out to hunt the northern lights.</p>
<p>However, there&rsquo;s no reason why you shouldn&rsquo;t get all excited about them! They truly are magnificent. Older generations say that you should whistle at the northern lights, and they reply to you by dancing in the sky. Try it!</p>

<p>This town is full of places where you can admire the scenery and natural phenomena such as the Midnight Sun or the northern lights. We&rsquo;ll introduce you to the two most popular places.</p>
<p>The first scenic spot we&rsquo;d like to introduce you to is the rooftop of the hotel Sky Ounasvaara. It&rsquo;s very popular for this purpose! There&rsquo;s a small fee &ndash; a couple of euros &ndash; you need to pay to access the rooftop, but it&rsquo;s worth it. You can take some spectacular pictures on the rooftop! </p>
<p>The second scenic spot is familiar to anyone in Rovaniemi: <strong>J&auml;tk&auml;nkynttil&auml; </strong>&ndash; the Lumberjack&rsquo;s Candle Bridge. What&rsquo;s more, it&rsquo;s also completely free of charge, of course!</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re thinking of investing in a multisensory experience, have dinner in the prestigious restaurant of Sky Ounasvaara. It won&rsquo;t be a cheap experience, but we guarantee that it will be a very enjoyable one: the restaurant has won several prizes and the panoramic windows offer a view you feel you could stare at forever &ndash; especially if the northern lights happen to make an entrance.</p>

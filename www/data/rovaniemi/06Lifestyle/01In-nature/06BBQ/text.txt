<p>Come summer, the ancient cave man instincts arise in many Finns! After failing in hunting local mammoths and other prospective game animals, we migrate towards the nearest supermarket, hoping to secure anything noteworthy to fill our bbq pits with.</p>
<p>To be honest, the Finnish barbeque season is way too short for any overtly fussy, chic, or fashionable dishes. <strong>Makkara</strong> &ndash; sausage, or often the Finnish equivalent to vegetables &ndash; does the trick just fine! For more advanced bbq enthusiasts, some pork, beef, or chicken can always be grilled. Add salmon to bring some Lappish taste, and some veggies for children, and you&rsquo;re the king or queen of the neighbourhood. Beer is optional, of course, but flatters ever-too-well the taste of any grilled dish!</p>
<p>One can never invest too much in bbq equipment. On the other hand, a true Finn will grill anything in the inherited excuse of a grill, the ugliest possible coal-driven piece of art hand-built by good ol&rsquo; grandfather. Even disposable bbq sets are sold at almost any gas station, much to the delight of the local fire department.</p>
<p>Speaking of fire, the building code strictly prevents you from using charcoal bbq equipment on your balcony! The same rule applies to the disposable ones as well, mind you, and the reason lies as much in your neighbour&rsquo;s well-being as in the safety regulations. </p>
<p>Having said all this, firing up your bbq and inviting your nearest and dearest is not too bad of a way to spend a summery Friday evening! Definitely part of the local lifestyle!</p>

<p>Enjoying the great outdoors is a major part of the northern lifestyle. In Rovaniemi, you can find hiking trails all over the town. Join the locals in enjoying what Mother Nature has bestowed upon Lapland.</p>
<p>Isorakka at Ounasvaara is a popular visiting point, and you can also mark your visit by writing your name and hiking distance in the ULapland notebook. If you look around at Isorakka, you&rsquo;ll see stones with ripple marks on their surface. They&rsquo;re here to remind us of the power of nature, as this place used to be one shore of the ancient lake Ancylus. </p>
<p>Lapland is full of stunning hiking trails. Visiting at least one of the national parks during your stay should definitely be on your list! It&rsquo;s easy to travel to these destinations from Rovaniemi &ndash; just take one of the buses that operate on these routes.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;re hiking in Lapland in the summer, be aware that you&rsquo;ll be accompanied by some mosquitoes. They&rsquo;re annoying, yes, and a mozzie bite will cause a small bump, that&rsquo;s for sure, but they&rsquo;re otherwise harmless. Wearing a mosquito hat or some repellent may be your choice. </p>
<p>By early September, the flying nuisances are usually gone due to temperatures falling close to zero degrees centigrade at night. That&rsquo;s also the time when the autumn colours start to paint the scenery yellow and red.</p>
<p>When the ground is covered by snow, many of the hiking trails are turned into well-groomed skiing trails. So, enjoying the great outdoors is customary year-round, and it&rsquo;s definitely something that every Laplander can relate to.</p>

<p>In the summer, the easiest way to fish is with a hook and line, because you don&rsquo;t need to purchase a permit. You can find inexpensive fishing kits for this purpose in supermarkets or petrol stations, containing a hook (<strong>koukku</strong>), line (<strong>siima</strong>) and bite indicator (<strong>koho</strong>). You can also purchase a rod (<strong>vapa</strong>) &ndash; or make one yourself. The river shore by the lean-to at Kirkonjyrh&auml;m&auml; (<strong>Kirkonjyrh&auml;m&auml;n laavu</strong>), near the church, is a good place for catching some perch (<strong>ahven</strong> &ndash; perca fluviatilis). <strong>Salmij&auml;rvi </strong>and <strong>Keinuvuopaja </strong>&ndash; a lake and pond in the area of <strong>P&ouml;ykk&ouml;l&auml; </strong>&ndash; are also popular. There are some fishing limitations in small rivers and creeks, so please check if there are any when purchasing a permit.</p>
<p>You need a permit for fly fishing (<strong>perhokalastus</strong>) and fishing with a rod and reel (<strong>virvelikalastus</strong>). You can get a permit by paying the fisheries management fee (<strong>kalastuksenhoitomaksu</strong>): you can choose between one-day, seven-day or annual permits. A one-day permit costs around five euros, and the cost of a seven-day permit is only some 12 euros. After you&rsquo;ve bought the permit <a href="http://www.eraluvat.fi/en/fishing/fishing-permits-and-fees.html">online</a>&nbsp;or at an <strong>R-kioski</strong>, you&rsquo;ll be glad to know that <strong>Mets&auml;hallitus</strong> uses the money for managing fisheries and securing the future of fishing in Finland.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You can fish with a rod and reel in Rovaniemi practically at any river or lake. Go to Vikak&ouml;ng&auml;s or Vaattunkik&ouml;ng&auml;s &ndash; some 20 km north of the town centre &ndash; to find particularly good places for fly fishing&nbsp; or fishing with a rod and reel. For these destinations, you&rsquo;ll also need the so-called <a href="http://www.eraluvat.fi/en/fishing/fishing-permits-and-fees/angling-permit.html">regional license</a>. Any store selling fishing equipment has staff members who can help you with choosing the most suitable lures &ndash; be it spoons (<strong>uistin</strong>) or flies (<strong>perho</strong>). Consult also other fishing entusiasts. Asking for advice in these matters is usually worth it!</p>
<p>Ice fishing (<strong>pilkkiminen</strong>) in winter is a popular hobby in Rovaniemi. It's also quite easy, as no permits are required. You just need an auger (<strong>kaira)</strong>, an ice-fishing rod (<strong>pilkki</strong>) with a hook, line and sinker, and plenty of warm clothes! Again, the shore by the <strong>Kirkonjyrh&auml;m&auml;n laavu </strong>is an excellent spot. Often you can even find ready-made holes in the ice there so you don&rsquo;t necessarily need to have an auger for drilling holes. An ice-fishing rod costs only a few euros, and you&rsquo;ll also find baits in supermarkets in the springtime.</p>
<p>In March and April, it&rsquo;s lovely to be out ice-fishing when the sun shines and there&rsquo;s still plenty of ice and snow. You can enjoy a cup of hot chocolate and sandwiches while enjoying the excitement that the possibility of catching some fish brings.</p>

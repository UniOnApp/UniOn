<p>Laplanders have a strong connection to nature, and our appreciation towards it shows in many ways. For example, it would be very hard for a Laplander to leave litter in the woods. Forests and the natural environment in general, in a sense, are something we have a lot of respect for. This also shows in the way we behave in nature.</p>
<p>According to the Everyman&rsquo;s rights &ndash; <a href="http://www.nationalparks.fi/hikinginfinland/rightsandregulations">jokamiehen oikeudet</a> &ndash; making fire is allowed only with permission from the landowner. In state-owned forests and national parks, it&rsquo;s allowed at designated places, such as lean-tos, where there&rsquo;s usually firewood available, too. The limitations are there not only to protect the natural environment and the fauna and flora that flourish there but also to protect us who visit it. There really is no playing with fire, but it can be lit if you know what, where and by whose permission you&rsquo;re doing it.</p>
<p>The rules are obvious to Laplanders, and the local lifestyle wouldn&rsquo;t be the same without the occasional leisurely afternoon spent sitting by a soothing campfire, frying sausages and sipping hot coffee out of a <strong>kuksa</strong>, a traditional wooden cup typically made of a burl. There&rsquo;s something therapeutic in gazing at the fire, listening to the silence, and &ndash; if you feel like it &ndash; talking about life with others present. The atmosphere, at its best, is similar to the one in the sauna: there&rsquo;s a sense of equality, mutual respect, and calmness.</p>

<p>Although many international visitors associate reindeer with Rudolph and Santa Claus, Laplanders primarily consider reindeer as food and livestock.</p>
<p>Reindeer are considered semi-tamed animals, as they roam freely in the wild for a large proportion of the year. The meat is lean and has a tender texture, and the flavour is similar to other game meats. It can be prepared fresh, dried, salted, and smoked.</p>
<p>There are many delicious, traditional ways of preparing reindeer meat. One of the more recent ones is to use reindeer meat for burgers. As any good burger, a reindeer burger is a meal that&rsquo;s tasty, hearty and something that truly tempts your tastebuds. Many local restaurants have reindeer burgers on the menu, why not try one!</p>

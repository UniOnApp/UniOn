Tap to read more about the below dishes &ndash; all of them have reindeer meat as the main ingredient.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<div class=\"ht\">\r\n<li>poroburgeri<\/li>\r\n<p>It&rsquo;s a reindeer burger!<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"ht\">\r\n<li>poropiirakka<\/li>\r\n<p>You might see this in caf&eacute;s as a savoury delicacy. The word means a reindeer pie or quiche. <\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"ht\">\r\n<li>poronk&auml;ristys<\/li>\r\n<p>Reindeer stew, <em>poronk&auml;ristys<\/em>, is a very traditional dish. It&rsquo;s served in restaurants around the country and at the dinner table in Lappish homes. The thinly sliced reindeer meat is served with sugared lingonberries or lingonberry jam and mashed potatoes. In a very authentic dish the potatoes used for the mash are no less than genuine Lapland almond potatoes, called <em>puikulaperuna<\/em>.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"ht\">\r\n<li>kylm&auml;savuporo<\/li>\r\n<p>Finnish compound nouns often look more difficult than they are: kylm&auml;-savu-poro, cold-smoke-reindeer. Thus, the word <em>kylm&auml;savuporo<\/em> means cold-smoked reindeer. The opposite would be <em>l&auml;mminsavuporo<\/em> &ndash; warm-smoked reindeer. <\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"ht\">\r\n<li>savuporoburgeri<\/li>\r\n<p>Smoked reindeer is also used as an ingredient in burgers. It can be a slice of cold-smoked reindeer to bring an exotic flavour to a beef patty or ground warm-smoked reindeer in the patty itself. Ask the waiter for details and find your favourite!<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"ht\">\r\n<li>savuporopasta<\/li>\r\n<p>Smoked reindeer pasta. It&rsquo;s delicious.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n  <\/div>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Based on the information provided above, can you figure out the meaning of these words? Tap to see the answer.<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<div class=\"ht\">\r\n<p>savu<\/p>\r\n<p><em>Savu<\/em> is the Finnish word for smoke. Smoking has long been a way of preparing reindeer in Lapland but smoking salmon and other fish is perhaps even more traditional. Smoking enhances the flavour of savoury delicacies.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n  <\/div>\r\n<div class=\"ht\">\r\n<p>poro<\/p>\r\n<p>Yes, this word is very important for anyone staying in Lapland: <em>poro<\/em> means reindeer!<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n  <\/div>\r\n<div class=\"ht\">\r\n<p>burgeri<\/p>\r\n<p>Also <em>hampurilainen<\/em> or <em>purilainen<\/em>. Nowadays, <em>burgeri<\/em> is a commonly used Finnish word for a burger &ndash; just add an i. The same rule applies to some other words with an international origin: hall &ndash; <em>halli<\/em>, theater &ndash; <em>teatteri<\/em>, concert &ndash; <em>konsertti<\/em>, for example. As you can see, in some words the spelling is tweaked to match the Finnish pronunciation.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n  <\/div>\r\n<div class=\"ht\">\r\n<p>piirakka<\/p>\r\n<p><em>Piirakka<\/em> is a pie, or a quiche if we&rsquo;d like to borrow the French word. <em>Piirakka<\/em> can be sweet or savoury &ndash; the preceding word determines the content. Obviously, <em>poropiirakka<\/em> is savoury, whereas <em>mustikkapiirakka<\/em> is sweet &ndash; can you guess what exactly?<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n  <\/div>\r\n<div class=\"ht\">\r\n<p>kylm&auml;<\/p>\r\n<p>This word will become bodily experienced when you&rsquo;re out and about in -25 degrees centigrade &ndash; <em>kylm&auml;<\/em> means cold! Cold-smoking, <em>kylm&auml;savustaminen<\/em>, is a way of preparing game meat and salmon, for example; the flavour of the ingredient is enhanced and refined.<\/p>\r\n  <\/div>",

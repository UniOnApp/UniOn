<p>The Finnish breadmaking culture has a long history, rye bread playing a very important role all the way. Rye bread, <strong>ruisleip&auml;</strong> in Finnish, was actually nominated the national food of Finland in January 2017 at the Nordic Travel Fair in Helsinki. Among the candidates for the nomination were other classics: Karelian stew, reindeer with mashed potatoes, and fried fish.</p>
<p>Rye bread is made of local ingredients, ripened under the Midnight Sun, thus being full of vitality, healthy vitamins and fibres. Moreover, the recipe is refined further decade by decade, century by century, thanks to the way it&rsquo;s prepared.</p>
<p>Local supermarkets and bakeries have a wide selection of rye bread. There are suitable options for different types of allergies as well, so that everyone can enjoy the flavour of Finnish rye bread. </p>

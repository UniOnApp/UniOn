<p>If you wish to understand Finnish everyday life, starting from a very substantial element such as coffee is not a bad idea. After all, it&rsquo;s present throughout the day in social situations.</p>
<p>Finns lead the global coffee consumption statistics together with the other Nordic countries. If you get an invitation to visit a Finnish home, expect to be offered coffee. Although some may think it&rsquo;s a bit retro, bringing a packet of high-quality coffee as a gift is considered very polite, although you don&rsquo;t need to worry very much about gift practices in this country: Finns appreciate the mere symbolic gesture of bringing a gift. Therefore, something understated such as a box of chocolates, some flowers or a packet of good coffee will be fine.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Finns start their morning by drinking coffee, and that&rsquo;s when it&rsquo;s called <em>aamukahvi </em>(morning coffee). Some drink it with milk and then it becomes <em>maitokahvi </em>(milk coffee). Some add sugar &ndash; <em>sokerilla</em> &ndash; whereas some prefer the good stuff simply black &ndash; <em>mustana</em>. Whatever the preference, coffee truly belongs to the Finnish morning!</p>
<p>A cup of coffee is also a fully appreciated dessert after your lunch or dinner. Actually, if you&rsquo;re not having anything on the side but are enjoying just the coffee, you&rsquo;re having <em>kaljup&auml;&auml;kahvit </em>(bald-head coffee).</p>
<p><em>P&auml;iv&auml;kahvi </em>(day coffee) is an afternoon break with a close friend or sweetheart; you never drink <em>p&auml;iv&auml;kahvi</em> alone, let&rsquo;s say. Although caution is needed with this word, it can also be used about a truly innocent meeting over coffee.</p>
<p>Some Finns even like to drink a cup or two in the evening, and then, logically, it&rsquo;s called <em>iltakahvi </em>(evening coffee).</p>

<p>Finns have a sweet tooth and we take specific pride in chocolate. Brands such as Fazer and Panda are famous throughout the country &ndash; and beyond &ndash; but also more local and regional companies are part of the pride. Many of our chocolatiers have studied in countries with a very long tradition in chocolate making, such as Belgium. After returning, they&rsquo;ve each harnessed their new knowledge and set of skills to create their own style.</p>
<p>Chocolate is made in Rovaniemi as well, and there&rsquo;s even a local ice cream company in this Arctic town. If you have a sweet tooth, head for the local caf&eacute;s! </p>

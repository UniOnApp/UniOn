<p>Something that&rsquo;s very characteristic of Finns is our coffee culture. Statistically, Finns drink a lot of coffee, leading the <a href="http://www.ico.org/">global coffee consumption statistics</a> together with the other Nordic countries. The coffee we prepare is soft and mild but deep-flavoured. Sometimes Finns like to say that the water quality is so good that no dark-roast beans are needed to bring out the coffee flavour. Who knows, but we sure love our coffee!</p>
<p>&nbsp;Coffee is often enjoyed with a sweet bun called <em>pulla</em>. Cakes, tarts, biscuits &ndash; even chocolate and ice cream &ndash; of various styles and flavours are also commonly enjoyed at the coffee table.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The deeper meaning of coffee for Finns lies in its role as a social lubricant. If you can&rsquo;t think of anything else to get the conversation going with a Finn, you can always start by saying something about the coffee you&rsquo;re (most likely) drinking. Actually, coffee is seen almost as a human right or at least a commodity that everyone&rsquo;s entitled to: coffee breaks at work were made statutory early on and coffee consumption is little affected by income levels.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s always a time and place for enjoying a nice cup of coffee. The intermission at the theatre is one of them, proven by the saying: <em>V&auml;liaika &ndash; kahvia ja pullaa!</em></p>

Tap to read about the topics. <\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<div class=\"ht\">\r\n<li>Coffee as a basic right<\/li>\r\n<p>Coffee breaks were included in Finnish general collective agreements early on, highlighting the fact that coffee is seen almost as a human right or at least a commodity that everyone&rsquo;s entitled to.<\/p>\r\n<p><\/p>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"ht\">\r\n<li>Coffee room at work<\/li>\r\n<p>A social room at work is called a coffee room, <em>kahvihuone<\/em> in Finnish. This room is where employees eat their packed lunch and have that very important statutory coffee break. Every faculty and unit has its own <em>kahvihuone<\/em>. <\/p>\r\n<p><\/p>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"ht\">\r\n<li>Coffee as a social lubricant<\/li>\r\n<p>Although the typical Finn is very genuine and kind at heart, Finns don&rsquo;t have a reputation of being very slick when it comes to romance. This is where coffee helps as well: inviting someone for a coffee can equal to a date or at least lead to one once the ball gets rolling.<\/p>\r\n<p><\/p>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"ht\">\r\n<li>Coffee in managing personal space<\/li>\r\n<p>When greeting, Finns are not very big in the body-language department. There&rsquo;s no hand-kissing, and &ndash; although not completely unknown &ndash; kisses on the cheek are rarely used. Actually, the only failsafe way to greet in Finland in formal situations is a brief and firm handshake while making eye contact. In fact, if you&rsquo;re holding a coffee cup, the handshake is also more practical than kisses &ndash; maybe that&rsquo;s one reason why Finns love to have a coffee cup in their hands.<\/p>\r\n<p><\/p>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"ht\">\r\n<li>Coffee consumption<\/li>\r\n<p>Finns drink a lot of coffee, leading the global coffee consumption statistics, together with the other Nordic countries. The taste of the Finnish-style coffee is soft and mild, yet deep-flavoured. <\/p>\r\n<p><\/p>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Are these claims oikein (correct) or v&auml;&auml;rin (incorrect)? Tap to check.<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<div class=\"ht\">\r\n<p><strong>Coffee is not important for Finns.<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p> <strong>V&auml;&auml;rin. Incorrect.<\/strong> The role of coffee in Finnish culture is very significant: It&rsquo;s the cornerstone of many social situations and it&rsquo;s even included in employees&rsquo; general collective agreements in workplaces. It&rsquo;s seen as a commodity that everyone&rsquo;s entitled to. <\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"ht\">\r\n<p><strong>The Finnish word for coffee is <em>tee<\/em>. <\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p> <strong>V&auml;&auml;rin. Incorrect.<\/strong> The word <em>tee<\/em> means tea. The word for coffee is <em>kahvi<\/em>.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<\/div>\r\n<div class=\"ht\">\r\n<p><strong>Finns often prefer a handshake when greeting in formal situations.<\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p> <strong>Oikein. Correct.<\/strong> The European habit of kisses on the cheek is not completely unknown but is rarely used. Besides, it would be impractical while holding a cup of coffee in your hands &ndash; a handshake gets the job done.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<\/div>",

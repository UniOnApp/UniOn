<p>In Finnish restaurants, or generally in the service sector, tips are not expected because service is always included in the price. However, if you feel that you&rsquo;ve received exceptionally good service and that someone has really taken the extra mile for you, feel free to tip. It&rsquo;s advisable to be discreet, though, as they may not be used to getting tipped.</p>
<p>Keep an eye out for a tip jar, <strong>tippikuppi</strong>, that you might see at the counter in restaurants, hotels or shops. In some local bars, if you tip at the bar, the bartender will pick up a bell as a sign of enthusiam of getting tipped &ndash; and to create a nice atmosphere. Sometimes tip-sy customers get excited about the bell sound and throw in some more change!</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s worth pointing out that the tipping culture seems to be gradually changing, since some restaurants have introduced a tipping option for card payments much like in many other countries where tipping is more common.</p>

<p>There was a time when Rovaniemi &ndash; like every other place in Finland &ndash; had a wealth of traditional grill kiosks, each with its own unique personality. You could get a heavy and greasy snack or meal for next to nothing &ndash; and could very well get a punch in the nose, too! These grills are disappearing at an alarming rate, pushed out by a veritable invasion of kebab caf&eacute;s and hamburger &ldquo;restaurants&rdquo;.</p>
<p>But you&rsquo;re in luck. Rovaniemi still has a few decent old-style grills left. One is the legendary Alakunnas drive-through grill. It&rsquo;s open practically all night and has a few special &ldquo;dishes&rdquo; that have retained their popularity year in year out. One worth trying is the VERY Finnish <strong>makkaraherkku</strong> (sausage delight) &ndash; sausages &amp; potatoes. The usual chaser is a half-litre of milk.&nbsp; Finns have a reputation for being heavy drinkers, right? It&lsquo;s well earned &ndash; in the case of milk anyway!</p>
<p>The best-known meal served at the Alakunnas grill is the <strong>Ropsilainen</strong>, named for RoPS, the local football club. Practice pronouncing the name, then step right up and order one in your best Finnish &ndash; so you don&rsquo;t attract too much attention. Do as the locals do and ask for your order with every spice in the house &ndash; <strong>kaikilla mausteilla</strong>!</p>

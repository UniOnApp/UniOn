<p>Finland is very well known for its heavy metal music scene, and there&rsquo;s no shortage of metal bands in the northern parts of the country either. However, other genres are also available. As in so many other student towns in Europe, at least Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday evenings in Rovaniemi paint a soundscape of electronically produced dance music. Parties often start at student apartments, but soon advance to many clubs in the town centre. Actually, apartment buildings have rules about silence starting in the buildings usually at 10 pm so continuing a loud party at a nightclub is not only polite but also required.</p>
<p>For serious clubbers, there&rsquo;s at least one club open every night of the year. Constant clubbing might have a serious effect on one&rsquo;s grades, though, so it could be wise to go out on the most popular nights. Weekend evenings are usually packed in local bars and clubs, followed by Wednesday, which is also known as <em>pikkulauantai</em> in Finnish (little Saturday). Some bars have discount evenings for students on Tuesdays and Thursdays, and one should keep a sharp lookout for visiting DJs and off-mainstream gigs around the week.</p>
<p>Clubbing is known to include a strong social dimension, and one part of the fun is getting to know interesting people.</p>

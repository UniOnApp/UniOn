<p>In the early hours of the evening, even on Fridays and Saturdays, some local pubs and bars may seem almost deserted. This shouldn&rsquo;t be taken as a sign of the locals being unsociable&ndash; all it means is that people spend time at home before storming to the local watering holes.</p>
<p>Having said this, you&rsquo;ll still be able to find a number of original pubs with lots of eccentric locals and an unbeatable atmosphere. The clientele is usually past their prime, and some of them can be rather opinionated. For some reason or another, karaoke has become the pastime of choice in many of these places. Try some of them just for fun, there could be a seat reserved just for you somewhere!</p>
<p>The names of these pubs are a living testament to the town&rsquo;s vivid history as the capital of Lapland: Uitto (The Logging), Koskikapakki (The Rapids Bar), Iloinen Ilves (The Happy Lynx), Hulibumba (The Party Hearty), and Pisto (The Stab), will get you started. All these are located in the town centre, though. For the most authentic &ndash; or eccentric &ndash; atmosphere you should head for the small bars in the suburbs.</p>
<p>The size of the pub, as well as its location, usually dictates the selection of beer available. You can always count on finding Finnish lager as the best selling beer of the bar, and there&rsquo;s usually at least two or three different brands on tap. Don&rsquo;t be surprised if you find your favourite beer from home; most of the pubs are proud to present a wide selection of exported beers as well as local gems brewed in one of the new Finnish microbreweries. There&rsquo;s even a brewery in Rovaniemi nowadays, founded in 2016.</p>
<p>Besides beer, there&rsquo;s usually a pretty good selection of cider available. If you really want to try something Finnish, though, you should go for a popular local choice called <strong>lonkero</strong>. Designed for the 1952 summer olympic games in Helsinki, the original idea was to keep the thousands of thirsty visitors happy. Today, there are lots of different versions available, but the original gin and grapefuit tasting long drink remains the one and only. The name of the drink has certainly helped: <em>long drink</em> became lonkero &ndash; a catchy and easily pronounceable word, literally meaning a tentacle!</p>

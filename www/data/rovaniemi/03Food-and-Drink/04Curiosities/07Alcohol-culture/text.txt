<p>Alcohol has its place in Finnish culture as much as in any national culture. However, you might have observed that there are some peculiarities in Finnish drinking &ndash; depending on your own national culture, of course.</p>
<p>One of the first observations might include the absence of alcohol from many everyday situations. Finnish alcohol culture is considered <em>exclusive</em>, meaning that it&rsquo;s not common to have glass of wine or a pint of beer during working hours &ndash; over lunch, for example. Even having a pint after work is not a very usual thing to do. In contrast to many Southern European countries, representatives of <em>inclusive</em> alcohol culture, Finnish weekdays go by without any alcohol &ndash; unless there&rsquo;s a good excuse for drinking.</p>
<p>This brings us to the other potential observation that you may have made: <em>excuses</em>. You might have already bumped into some locals downing their tenth pint, or carefully counting alcohol and price ratios in the selection of their nearby alcohol store, ALKO. Indeed, binge drinking is still rather common in Finland, much like in other Nordic countries. Being drunk is not always socially acceptable, but Finns seem to have a rather high tolerance for drunk people. This is especially true if the person in question has an exceptionally good reason for drinking, such as a national holiday, birthday, a new job, a friend&rsquo;s wedding, the first day of spring, Finland beating Sweden in ice hockey, Friday evening, or a new pair of socks!</p>
<p>So, join the party, be yourself from an inclusive or from an exclusive alcohol culture! Just remember to get your beer from the supermarket before 9 pm, and your wine from ALKO even earlier.</p>

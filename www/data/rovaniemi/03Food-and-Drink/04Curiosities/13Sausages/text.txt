<p>Many Finns have a strong connection to nature, and that&rsquo;s why we love to go walking, hiking, skiing or snowshoeing. Having a packed lunch or some sandwiches and other supplies in the backpack is most definitely part of the picture, as enjoying a meal outdoors, close to nature, evokes positive emotions in most Finns. Be it winter, spring, summer or autumn, frying sausages, <strong>makkaranpaisto</strong>, is an essential activity &ndash; almost a ritual &ndash; when you&rsquo;re out and about in nature. There are outdoor campfire pits and huts freely available for anyone&rsquo;s responsible use.</p>
<p>Our strong connection to nature, and love for sausages, are probably major reasons for why so many house owners have built a barbeque hut in the garden: you can easily get close to nature again and enjoy a hot sausage, <strong>makkara</strong>, with some mustard, <strong>sinappi</strong>. It&rsquo;s also a place where you can relax, talk with your friends and family and really focus on enjoying their company; after all, there really are no distractions in a small barbeque hut.</p>
<p>The habit of heading for the woods or fells has its background in local history. Distances have always been long in this sparsely populated area in the northern Europe, and before the invention of modern vehicles, such as trains or cars, people truly had to pack some supplies when they were going someplace further from their home village &ndash; to visit the nearest harvest market, to hunt game or to gather berries. So, enjoying a packed meal and frying sausages constitute an activity that has a touch of survival of our ancestors and a hint of childhood nostalgia, too, because this activity has been customary over generations. Sunday picnics on a freshly mowed lawn in the middle of a big city don&rsquo;t come even close to the essence of what Finnish <strong>makkaranpaisto </strong>is.</p>
<p>When you&rsquo;re planning your own excursion into the woods, start by deciding what you&rsquo;re going to wear and eat. Wear practical clothes and, if it&rsquo;s cold, wear enough warm layers. OK, that&rsquo;s it. Now to the more important part. </p>
<p>The sausage section in any of the local supermarkets will have plenty of choice. Remember to buy sausages, mustard and rye bread. You can prepare sandwiches and use the kind of fillings you like &ndash; butter, cheese and cold cuts are commonly used &ndash; and wrap that beauty in parchment paper. Avoid using too many fillings, though: keeping the sandwich practical is essential because you&rsquo;ll have to hold a hot cup of coffee in your other hand! Not going overboard with the fillings is also culturally advisable. Making your sandwiches too fancy (read: better than others&rsquo; sandwiches) will not represent the essence of <strong>makkaranpaisto. </strong>The activity also has a sense of equality, even companionship to some extent. So, you should rather aim at having an equally good sandwich and <strong>makkara</strong> as the others, and enjoying them together around the same campfire. </p>

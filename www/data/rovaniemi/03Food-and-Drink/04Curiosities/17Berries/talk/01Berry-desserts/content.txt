Tap on the dessert to read about it.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n<div class=\"ht\">\r\n<p>Mustikkapiirakka<\/p>\r\n<p>Blueperry pie. It&rsquo;s a classic, and it&rsquo;s served around the country. Like all other berries, blueberries that grow and ripen under the Midnight Sun are very intensive in taste &ndash; that&rsquo;s why some would rather like to call them bilberries to differentiate them from &ldquo;regular&rdquo; blueberries. If you visit a Finnish home at the end of July, especially in the countryside, it&rsquo;s likely that you&rsquo;re offered a slice of blueberry pie at the coffee table. There are different styles of blueberry pies but they&rsquo;re all delicious. Many Finns consider that the taste of fresh blueberry pie with a glass of milk brings back sweet memories from childhood!<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n  <\/div>\r\n<div class=\"ht\">\r\n<p>Hillaa ja leip&auml;juustoa<\/p>\r\n<p>Cloudberries and Finnish squeaky cheese. This is truly a Lappish dessert! The combination of this mild cheese and piquant cloudberries is something you need to try whilst in Lapland! The milk used in the squeaky cheese is often cow&rsquo;s milk, but also reindeer&rsquo;s or goat&rsquo;s milk can be used.<\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n  <\/div>\r\n<div class=\"ht\">\r\n<p>Marjapuuro<\/p>\r\n<p>Literally translated, this is berry porridge. Trust us, it tastes better than it sounds! <strong>Marjapuuro <\/strong>is a sweet, wheat semolina dessert porridge made with lingonberries. Naturally, other berries can also be used but lingonberries are the most common ones for this dish. The dessert is usually served with sugar and milk, but you can make it more luxurious with cream or vanilla sauce. Depending on the region, this dessert is called either <strong>marjapuuro<\/strong>, <strong>vispipuuro<\/strong> or <strong>lappapuuro. <\/strong><\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n  <\/div>\r\n<div class=\"ht\">\r\n<p>Marjarahka<\/p>\r\n<p>Berry quark. Quark is a popular ingredient in home-made desserts around the country: It&rsquo;s quick to prepare a dessert by mixing some quark with fruit or berries. Quark is also generally considered healthy, and even the smallest supermarkets always have it. <\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n  <\/div>\r\n<div class=\"ht\">\r\n<p>Marjakiisseli<\/p>\r\n<p><strong>Marjakiisseli<\/strong> means berry kissel. The word <strong>kiisseli <\/strong>&ndash; or kissel &ndash; has Slavic origins: based on some etymological data, the word was originally derived from a Slavic word for <em>sour<\/em>. It&rsquo;s a dessert with a viscous consistency, and it&rsquo;s typical in the countryside. It&rsquo;s made of sweetened juice of berries and thickened with potato starch; berries are added at the end. <\/p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\r\n  <\/div>\r\n<div class=\"ht\">\r\n<p>Mansikkakakku<\/p>\r\n<p>Strawberry cake.

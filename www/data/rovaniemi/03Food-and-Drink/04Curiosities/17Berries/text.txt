<p>The climate in Lapland is not favourable for traditional garden fruits, such as pears or plums. You can grow them further south in Finland, whereas the natural environment of Lapland is bestowed with a variety of wild delicacies: cloudberries, crowberries, cranberries, blueberries (also referred to as bilberries), blackberries, lingonberries, raspberries, red currants, black currants, strawberries &ndash; to name only a few. Berries in Lapland grow under the Midnight Sun and, thus, are typically very intensive in taste and packed with a range of vitamins.</p>
<p>These wild delicacies are found in abundance and can be gathered by anyone thanks to <a href="http://www.ymparisto.fi/en-US/Nature/Everymans_rights(27721)">the Everyman&rsquo;s Rights</a>. Berries are also prepared in many ways: you can find different types of baked goods, cakes, chocolate and even ice cream that are made with Lappish berries.</p>

<p>The Martha Organization is focused mainly on home economics and organising courses aiming to train those skills. It was founded in Finland in 1899 to promote well-being and quality of life in the home. Matters such as food and nutrition, home gardening and environmental protection, and household economics and consumer issues are at the core of the activity. The Martha Organization is known locally as <strong>Martat</strong> &ndash; the Marthas. You can also sometimes see them campaign alongside other organisations with goals similar to theirs.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The local Martat organise cooking courses that you can participate in. Traditional and more contemporary food is prepared, depending on the course &ndash; why not participate with a group of friends!</p>

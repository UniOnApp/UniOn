<p>Finns eat a lot of fish. Especially salmon is popular because it can be prepared quickly and easily in so many ways. When you&rsquo;re buying salmon in the supermarket, however, you&rsquo;ll notice that there are various types available: there&rsquo;s Norwegian salmon, rainbow trout or wild salmon from the Tornionjoki river.</p>
<p>Rainbow trout,<strong> kirjolohi</strong> (Oncorhynchus mykiss) is mostly farmed and very popular all over the country. There are a couple of rainbow trout farms in the Rovaniemi region, too. Rainbow trout is a good choice not only because of its high quality and fine taste, but also because hatcheries and fish farms have become more eco-friendly nowadays.</p>
<p>Norwegian salmon, <strong>Norjan lohi</strong>, means farmed Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) produced in Norway. Often, Norwegian salmon is more inexpensive than rainbow trout, making it a very popular choice as well. There&rsquo;s some controversy about how eco-friendly the production process of Norwegian salmon is.</p>
<p><strong>Villi lohi</strong> means wild salmon (Salmo salar). Original salmon populations in Finland have suffered greatly from the effects of dams and power plants that have been built in Finnish waterways over the last century. Other human activities have made living conditions more difficult for wild salmon in the Baltic Sea. There are some original salmon populations left, however, in the <strong>Tornionjoki</strong> and <strong>Simojoki</strong> rivers that flow into the Gulf of Bothnia, and in <strong>Tenojoki</strong> and <strong>N&auml;&auml;t&auml;m&ouml;joki</strong> rivers that flow into the Arctic Ocean. Wild salmon reside in these rivers, and they&rsquo;re caught traditionally by fishing. Wild salmon is very tasty and of high quality. </p>

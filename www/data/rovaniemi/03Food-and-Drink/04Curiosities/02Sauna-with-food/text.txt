<p>How would you feel about combining sauna, swimming and good food under the Midnight Sun? What&rsquo;s more, all this would take place on a comfortable raft on the Kemijoki river!</p>
<p>There are some sauna rafts that you can rent. You can enjoy a sauna bath while admiring the scenery that slowly passes by, and have your own picnic on the raft. There&rsquo;s also a lovely summer restaurant by the river shore, not only serving tasty food but also a possibility to enjoy the sauna. Truly an experience!</p>

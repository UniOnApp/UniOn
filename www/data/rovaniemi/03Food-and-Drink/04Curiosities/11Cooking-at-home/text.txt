<p>For many Finns, home is the focus of social life. Therefore, cooking at home is one of the many social activities that families and friends do together. Cooking is often carried out as a joint activity: someone takes care of preparing the salad and someone else sees to the warm dish, for example. Kids often help by setting the table or chopping vegetables. </p>
<p>Finns do like to go out to eat, too, but the relatively high price level in restaurants does its part in making cooking at home an economically sound choice as well. Eating out is more of an indulgence that takes place from time to time.</p>
<p>Mealtimes vary between families, but as a general rule, dinnertime is somewhere between 5 and 7 pm; much earlier than in the southern parts of Europe, for example. The specific mealtime is, naturally, determined by the schedule of the family, and food is prepared when you come home from work and school: office jobs begin between 8 and 9 am, and the workday is over at 4 or 5 pm. Blue-collar jobs can begin at 7 am, so the workday ends at 3 pm.</p>
<p>All children get a warm meal for lunch at school, and parents have a 30&ndash;40 minute lunchbreak at work &ndash; usually somewhere between 11 am and 1 pm.</p>
<p>The local Martha Organization, <strong>Martat</strong>, organizes cooking courses you can participate in. The courses are themed: some are about traditional food, whereas others are about contemporary cooking; the local Martha Organization sometimes offers cake and pastry courses, too.</p>

<p>When it comes to public holidays or smaller celebrations, food plays a central role, of course. Annual celebrations include <strong>joulu</strong> &ndash; Christmas, <strong>uudenvuodenaatto</strong> &ndash; New Year&rsquo;s Eve, <strong>laskiainen</strong> &ndash; Shrovetide, <strong>p&auml;&auml;si&auml;inen</strong> &ndash; Easter, <strong>vappu </strong>&ndash; Labour Day, <strong>juhannus</strong> &ndash; Midsummer, <strong>itsen&auml;isyysp&auml;iv&auml;</strong> &ndash; Independence Day; every celebration has its own characteristic food. </p>
<p>Birthday parties often include a cake &ndash; <strong>kakku</strong> &ndash; with candles on top. A wedding &ndash; <strong>h&auml;&auml;t</strong> &ndash; is not a wedding without a centrepiece cake for the couple to cut together as a symbol of their dedication to one another and the beginning of their journey as a married couple. </p>
<p>Festive plates in local restaurants often include <strong>lohi </strong>&ndash; salmon, <strong>siika</strong> &ndash; whitefish, and <strong>poro </strong>&ndash; reindeer, prepared in different ways. Cold-smoked salmon is a very popular delicacy, with lightly salted whitefish and bite-sized reindeer sausages or cold cuts following suit. They&rsquo;re popular around the year but over Christmas especially. </p>
<p>For many families, <strong>joulukinkku</strong> &ndash; a Christmas ham, is still the food that truly brings Christmas with it; this has been a tradition for centuries. <strong>Porkkanalaatikko </strong>&ndash; carrot casserole, and <strong>lanttulaatikko</strong> &ndash; rutabaga casserole, are equally important. <strong>Rosolli</strong> is a mixture of chopped beetroot, apple, pickled cucumber, carrot, cooked potato, and onion; very typical around Christmas. <strong>Piparkakku </strong>or<strong> pipari</strong> &ndash; our gingerbread cookie, and <strong>joulutorttu</strong> &ndash; a Finnish star-shaped plum pastry, are part of the picture, as is <strong>gl&ouml;gi</strong>, a sweet, typically non-alcoholic Christmas drink; somewhat similar to mulled wine. Christmas doesn&rsquo;t go unnoticed at the university either, as <strong>gl&ouml;gi</strong> and other delicacies are brought into the selection in the cafeterias well before Christmas.</p>

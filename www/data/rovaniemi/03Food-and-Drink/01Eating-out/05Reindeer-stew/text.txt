<p>Reindeer stew, <strong>poronk&auml;ristys</strong>, is a very traditional dish. It&rsquo;s served in restaurants around the country and, in Lapland, at homemade family dinners. The thinly sliced reindeer meat is enjoyed with sugared lingonberries or lingonberry jam, and mashed potatoes. This hearty meal is perfect for cold winter nights!</p>
<p>You can get reindeer stew in many restaurants in Rovaniemi, for example in Pohjanhovi &ndash; one of the most famous hotels in Finland! It was originally opened in 1936 to cater to the needs of the rising tourism industry in the northern parts of Europe. In autumn 1944, during the Second World War, this beautiful building, known as the Pearl of Rovaniemi, was blown into bits and pieces by the retreating German troops.</p>
<p>Pohjanhovi was rebuilt in 1947 and quickly rose back to its glory. Our long-standing president Urho Kekkonen visited Pohjanhovi several times, and in 1961 he even brought Leonid Brezhnev, president of the Soviet Union, to Lapland and to Pohjanhovi. The restaurant has always been famous for its unique atmosphere. For decades, people have come here from far away to enjoy <strong>poronk&auml;ristys</strong>.</p>

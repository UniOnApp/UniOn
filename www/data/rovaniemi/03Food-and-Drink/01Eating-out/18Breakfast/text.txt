<p>In general, Finns like to eat a nutritious breakfast. Some like to have a bowl of hot porridge with some fresh berries, while some prefer a slice of rye bread or wholegrain toast; Karelian pie &ndash; <strong>karjalanpiirakka</strong> &ndash; is typical, too. Yoghurt and muesli are globally popular and very typical in Finland, too. Coffee, tea, fruit juice or berry juice belong to the Finnish breakfast table as well. </p>
<p>The Finnish word for breakfast is <strong>aamiainen</strong> or <strong>aamupala</strong>. The word for morning, then again, is <strong>aamu</strong> &ndash; note the very long double-a when pronouncing! So, it&rsquo;s quite obvious that the Finnish words <strong>aamiainen</strong> and <strong>aamupala</strong> refer to a light meal or snack in the morning. </p>
<p>A more luxurious version of the typical breakfast is, of course, served at hotels. If you wish to indulge yourself sometime, head for one of the local hotels in the morning to buy yourself breakfast! Go alone or with some friends to soak up the international atmosphere of Rovaniemi from another perspective.</p>

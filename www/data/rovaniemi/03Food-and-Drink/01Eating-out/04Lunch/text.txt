<p>Even though Finnish cooking might seem simple at first, Finns are very passionate about food and love to celebrate it; lunch is no exception. The most common Finnish lunch consists of a warm meal, accompanied by a rich salad, and bread with butter on the side. The options on the menu often include an option with fish, another one with meat, and a dish suitable for vegetarians. Allergies and conditions such as lactose intolerance and coeliac disease are usually considered. Common dishes include casseroles, soups, meatballs with mashed potatoes, smoked ham or beef, salmon prepared in different ways, pea soup served with a pancake dessert &ndash; and many more. Not to forget, Finns often eat lunch with a cold glass of milk, <strong>maito</strong>, or some non-alcoholic ale, <strong>kotikalja</strong>.</p>
<p>Salads are served with a variety of different vegetables and fruit, such as watermelon, orange, or pineapple. You&rsquo;ll also find many warm dishes perfected with a natural, sweet flavour: some homemade berry jam or fresh berries, picked from nearby forests, can sometimes be added to the side of cabbage rolls or reindeer stew, for example.</p>
<p>Often Finns just like to have a cup of coffee after lunch, and maybe a sweet bun called <strong>pulla</strong>. If a Finn goes for a dessert at lunchtime, you might see an ice cream scoop or Finnish squeaky cheese, <strong>leip&auml;juusto</strong>, with some cloudberries, on the plate. </p>
<p>Be ready to come to the lunch table around 11 am, and instead of saying &ldquo;bon app&eacute;tit&rdquo;, try to surprise your Finnish friends by saying <strong>hyv&auml;&auml; ruokahalua</strong>!</p>

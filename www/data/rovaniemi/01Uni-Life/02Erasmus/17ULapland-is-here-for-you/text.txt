<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If you&rsquo;re an exchange student, the Internationalisation Services are here to help you with your learning agreement and the courses you&rsquo;re planning to take during your exchange at ULapland.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">If you&rsquo;re looking to extend your exchange for another term, as many do, you can get advice on that in the same office. Please check the office hours when planning your visit.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The staff members of the Internationalisation Services are pretty sharp linguistically, so why not try your Finnish on them! You can break the ice &ndash; although there&rsquo;s no ice to break with these easy-going folks &ndash; by talking about the languages you and they speak.</span></p>

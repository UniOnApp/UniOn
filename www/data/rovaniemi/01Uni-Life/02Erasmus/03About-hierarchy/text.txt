We have no strict hierarchy between teachers and students, meaning that you don’t need to be nervous about how to meet and greet a teacher: just be yourself and you’ll be fine. Specific titles or forms of address do no harm, but are unnecessary in everyday contexts.<br><br>

You can begin your e-mails to a teacher by simply typing the neutral yet cordial Hello or Hi. If you’re accustomed to and prefer more formality, Dear Professor or Dear Teacher will work fine as well.<br><br>

If you’ve got a meeting with a teacher or a professor in their office and you’ve never met before, you can introduce yourself with a handshake. It should be brief and firm and accompanied by eye contact. It’s also polite to stand up when shaking hands.<br><br>

In informal situations a nod of the head or raising your hand with a short greeting like <u>hei</u> or <u>moi</u> is certainly polite enough.<br><br>

Embracing people when greeting is common only among close friends and relatives, and mostly among women. Finnish men embrace each other only when Finland has won the gold medal in the Ice Hockey World Championships. The European habit of kissing another person on the cheek is not entirely unknown in Finland, but Finns rarely do so.

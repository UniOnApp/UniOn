<p class="p1"><span class="s1">There are some signs and notes in and around the University with useful information. Here are our picks for you!</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>saa ottaa</strong> If you see the words &ldquo;saa ottaa&rdquo; written next to a bunch of stuff at the University, it means it&rsquo;s a recycling point of the ULapland community, where staff members usually put usable items, such as binders or other office supplies, available for anyone to take and use. Saves you from shopping!</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>taluta py&ouml;r&auml;&auml;</strong> This is important information for cyclists. The words &ldquo;taluta py&ouml;r&auml;&auml;&rdquo; mean &ldquo;walk your bike&rdquo;. You can see this sign at some bridges.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>kulje oikealla</strong> The words &ldquo;kulje oikealla&rdquo; can be spotted at the railway bridge. The words mean &ldquo;walk or ride on the right&rdquo;.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>ohita vasemmalta</strong> The words &ldquo;ohita vasemmalta&rdquo; can also be spotted at the railway bridge. The words mean &ldquo;pass on the left&rdquo;.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>pelastustie</strong> Directly translated, this means a rescue way. It must be kept clear of any obstacles, to allow the fire brigade, first aid or the police access in case of an emergency.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1"><strong>parasta ennen</strong> The expression &ldquo;best before&rdquo; is familiar from the mundane milk carton, but we use this expression in other contexts as well, often in a joking way.</span></p>

<p>Another University&hellip; of Lapland? Indeed, there are two sectors in the Finnish higher education system: universities of applied sciences (UAS) and universities. They both provide higher education but with slightly different emphases. Universities of applied sciences train professionals to meet the needs of the job market and contribute to regional development.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.lapinamk.fi/en">Lapland UAS</a> has campuses in Rovaniemi, Kemi, and Tornio. There are around 5,000 students studying in four fields:</p>
<p>&bull; Social services, health and sports</p>
<p>&bull; Business and culture</p>
<p>&bull; Travel and tourism</p>
<p>&bull; Industry and natural resources.</p>
<p>ULapland and Lapland UAS join forces in the Lapland University Consortium, LUC. You see LUC in the LUC Library, joint sports, or the chance to take courses offered right next door!</p>

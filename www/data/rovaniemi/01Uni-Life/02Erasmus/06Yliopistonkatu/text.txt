Our University is near the centre of Rovaniemi and the Arctic Circle. The campus is modern yet close to nature – like the whole town. Nature is everywhere you look – up, down and all around you – creating a unique setting for your study experience.<br><br>

Take a couple of minutes between classes to take a walk on the paths behind the University. Enjoy the fresh air and the peace and quiet, and see if there are any birds or skiers on the nearby pond. In autumn and winter, you can get a glimpse of the northern lights if you’re lucky.

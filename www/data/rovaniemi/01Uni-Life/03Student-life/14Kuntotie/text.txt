<b>Onnea uuteen kotiin!</b> That’s what we say in Finnish when we go to a housewarming party; it’s basically a wish for happiness in the new home.<br><br>

Kuntotie is where many university students live. The area has its own community atmosphere; it’s almost like a village. <br><br>

For Finns, home is often the focus of social life: it’s customary to invite your friends over for coffee and pastries. There’s a specific type of sweet bun, pulla, that’s a must on the Finnish coffee table.<br><br>

You could try throwing your housewarming party the Finnish way! That’d include at least making lots of coffee and your guests leaving their shoes in the hall!

The Finnish winter is long and dark, although the glistening of the snow does nicely light up the environment. The student union is quite active here, ensuring that you won’t get bored even around mid-winter! Many of the events are sporty and take place outdoors. Snow soccer is a lot of fun! <br><br>

The University cares about students’ well-being. One way we do this is regular sports afternoons, one in September and another one in February. Students can also sign up for the rowing team, which competes against Lapland University of Applied Sciences every September.

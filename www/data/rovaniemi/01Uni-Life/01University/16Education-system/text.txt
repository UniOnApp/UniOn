<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The Finnish education system fares well in international assessments, such as the PISA study. Finnish children start school at the age of seven, and most attend one year of pre-school before that. Basic education has nine grades, after which - at the age of 16 &ndash; youngsters choose either high school or vocational school &ndash; or a combination of both. This second cycle takes three years, and the third cycle &ndash; a degree at the university or university of applied sciences &ndash; takes anywhere between three and x number of years. The suggested time for completing a master&rsquo;s degree is five years. There are various options for further education as well.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The education system works well and there are synergies between institutions: our Faculty of Education works closely with the local teacher training school, with many future teachers doing their practical training there.</span></p>
<p class="p2">Honesty is highly valued and maintained in Finland: it&rsquo;s important to keep your promises and take responsibility for your words and actions. In studies, our appreciation for honesty shows in our strict disapproval of plagiarism and cheating. We start teaching this culture at school from the first grade on.</p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">University studies here may differ somewhat from those in other countries. The assignments you&rsquo;ll get, such as lecture journals or essays, may be different from what you&rsquo;re used to.</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Lecture journal: A lecture journal, </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s3">luentop&auml;iv&auml;kirja</span></span><span class="s1"> in Finnish, could also be called a course diary or a course report. The journal should comment on the themes of the lectures and reflect on them.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">When you&rsquo;ve written up your journal, you give it to the teacher, who will then assess it. The length can vary, because it depends on the course. Always include your name, student number and the name of the course and the lecturer on every paper you hand in.</span></p>
<ul>
<li class="li1"><span class="s1">Essay: An essay, </span><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><span class="s3">essee</span></span><span class="s1"> in Finnish, is a piece of academic writing in which you examine the literature you&rsquo;ve read in terms of a particular question or topic and present your views in an organised and analytical way. An essay does not involve summarising, but rather reflecting on, analyzing and critiquing the material.</span></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The length of an essay depends on the number of credits it carries. On some courses, it can be possible to compensate for an absence by writing an essay. You should confirm this first by asking your teacher, however.</span></p>

<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The University of Lapland is the only university in Finland that offers tourism research as a major subject. The major subject is organised in collaboration between the Faculty of Social Sciences and Multidimensional Tourism Institute. <a href="http://matkailu.luc.fi/In-English/Main-Page">MTI</a>&nbsp;is also the largest expert organisation in the field in Lapland: it brings together the know-how at Lapland Tourism College, the University of Lapland and Lapland University of Applied Sciences. MTI boasts a student body of over 1200 students and a staff of 120.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The multidisciplinary subject of tourism research examines tourism from various viewpoints: tourism is treated as a societal phenomenon, as a livelihood, as an industry providing culture, and experiences, as work, as a business, as consumption, and as a factor affecting its own working environment. MTI also cooperates closely with the business community in Lapland.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">In fact, thanks to their language skills, many international students work part-time in local tourism companies. Some of them have studied Finnish to an advanced level and have found permanent jobs. Some have taken it even further by falling in love with a local, getting married and starting a family up here in the North! </span></p>

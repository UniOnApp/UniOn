Teaching is a high-status job in Finland and teachers have a great deal of freedom – and responsibility – in planning the syllabus. At ULapland, we trust our students to be independent as well: make sure you’ve understood the teacher’s guidelines, participate actively on the courses you take and in student life in general. Don’t be too shy to ask if something’s unclear to you!

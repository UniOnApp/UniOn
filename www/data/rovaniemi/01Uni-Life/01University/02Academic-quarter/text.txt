<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Sometimes it may seem that it&rsquo;s astonishingly important for Finns to be on time: it&rsquo;s part of the culture up here to give a great deal of respect to timetables.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">The &ldquo;academic quarter&rdquo; (<strong>akateeminen vartti</strong> in Finnish) &ndash; is the quarter-hour between the official time a lecture is supposed to begin and the time it actually does. This practice is commonplace in many European universities.</span></p>
<p class="p1"><span class="s1">Because Finns are very punctual, we follow this practice to the minute: when a lecture is supposed to begin at quarter past, it does &ndash; bang on schedule. The same goes for any meeting or event.</span></p>

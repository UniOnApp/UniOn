Sssh...quiet please! The library is an active learning environment and a meeting point, but itâ€™s also a quiet place for reading and studying.<br>

The University Library is part of the LUC Libraries. Kirjasto is the Finnish word for library.<br>

The University Library is open to all, serving primarily students and personnel but also the general public.

Today we have about 5,000 students in four faculties: Art and Design, Education, Law, and Social Sciences. The University is also home to <a href="http://matkailu.luc.fi/In-English/Main-Page"><span class="s1">MTI &ndash; Multidimensional Tourism Institute</span></a>, <a href="http://www.arcticcentre.org/EN"><span class="s3">the Arctic Centre</span></a>, and a couple of other institutes as well.</span></p>

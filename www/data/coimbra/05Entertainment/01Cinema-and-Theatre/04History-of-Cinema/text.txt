<p>The Golden Age of Portuguese cinema is said to fall on the 1930s-40s, when numerous comedies, musicals and historical films were produced. It also happens to coincide with the height of the Estado Novo dictatorship that saw cinema as its important ideological tool.</p>
<p>Movies like <em>&ldquo;A Can&ccedil;&atilde;o de Lisboa</em>&rdquo;, &ldquo;<em>Aldeia da Roupa Branca</em>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<em>O P&aacute;tio das Cantigas</em>&rdquo;, starring two of the country's most favourite actors, Vasco Santana and Ant&oacute;nio Silva; &ldquo;<em>A Menina da R&aacute;dio</em>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<em>O Le&atilde;o da Estrela</em>&rdquo; focused on everyday life and are such a part of the Portuguese culture that had remakes in 2015 and 2016, by Leonel Vieira and Pedro Varela. Sagas like &ldquo;<em>Bocage</em>&rdquo;, &ldquo;<em>In&ecirc;s de Castro</em>&rdquo; or &ldquo;<em>Cam&otilde;es</em>&rdquo; were used by the Estado Novo regime for spreading its interpretation of national history. Movies starring the queen of fado Am&aacute;lia Rodrigues (&ldquo;<em>Capas Negras</em>&rdquo; and &ldquo;<em>Fado, Hist&oacute;ria de uma Cantadeira</em>&rdquo;) appropriated cultural aspects of fado to help shape the Portuguese national identity.</p>
<p>Manoel de Oliveira&rsquo;s film &ldquo;Aniki-B&oacute;b&oacute;&rdquo; (1942) anticipated Italian neorealism. The veteran of the Portuguese cinema filmed it on location in Porto and focused on the lives of a child gang. &ldquo;<em>Novo Cinema</em>&rdquo;, inspired by the neorealism and by the French &ldquo;Nouvelle Vague&rdquo;, became popular in the 1960s-70s as a new type of political cinema (&ldquo;<em>Belarmino</em>&rdquo;, by Fernando Lopes or &ldquo;<em>As Armas e o Povo</em>&rdquo; by Ant&oacute;nio da Cunha Telles). They fostered political and social conscience in people - something that the dictatorship urged to suppress.</p>
<p>The colonial war and Lisbon&rsquo;s underground life and social problems were main topics for the films produced in 1980s-90&rsquo;s. Box-office hits like &ldquo;<em>O Lugar do Morto</em>&rdquo;, by Ant&oacute;nio Pedro Vasconcelos, &ldquo;<em>A Mulher do Pr&oacute;ximo</em>&rdquo;, by Jos&eacute; Fonseca e Costa, and &ldquo;<em>Zona J</em>&rdquo;, by Leonel Vieira were released then.</p>
<p>Jo&atilde;o C&eacute;sar Monteiro with &ldquo;<em>Recorda&ccedil;&otilde;es da Casa Amarela</em>&rdquo;, won a Silver Lion in Venice, Teresa Villaverde with &ldquo;<em>Os Mutantes</em>&rdquo;, won Un Certain Regard in Cannes and Pedro Costa&nbsp;with &ldquo;<em>No Quarto da Vanda</em>&rdquo; won the France Culture Award for Foreign Cineaste of the Year.</p>
<p>The 2000s have brought a whole new generation of Portuguese filmmakers and actors.<br /> &ldquo;<em>O Crime do Padre Amaro</em>&rdquo;, a free adaptation of a novel by E&ccedil;a de Queir&oacute;s (1875) and a critique of the social and clerical hypocrisy, was a huge box-office hit that grossed over a million euro.</p>
<p>In 2009, a young director Jo&atilde;o Salaviza&nbsp;won the Golden Palm at Cannes for his short film &ldquo;Arena&rdquo;. In three years, he won the Golden Bear in Berlin for another film &ldquo;Rafa&rdquo;. At the same festival,&nbsp;Miguel Gomes,&nbsp;the director of &ldquo;<em>Aquele Querido M&ecirc;s de Agosto</em>&rdquo;, won the Alfred Bauer Award for his feature film &ldquo;Tabu&rdquo;.</p>

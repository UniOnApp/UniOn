<p>TAGV, or Teatro Acad&eacute;mico Gil Vicente is the only university theatre in Portugal. Inaugurated in 1961, it was named after the father of the Portuguese drama, Gil Vicente. His plays marked the transition from the Middle Ages to the Renaissance, and helped shape the Portuguese language.</p>
<p>The 'acad&eacute;mico' in its name not only identifies this theatre as part of the University of Coimbra but also means that the theatre is a school itself. Masterclasses, internships and courses in acting, dance, cinema and classical music are regularly held here.&nbsp;</p>
<p>After its renovation in 2003, TAGV has been stage to a variety of events, from political meetings and university conferences to poetry readings, film screenings, drama, ballet, jazz, and contemporary dance performances. Regular series include <em>Festival do Cinema Franc&ecirc;s</em>, thematic documentary cycles, and the yearly <em>semana cultural acad&eacute;mica</em> with a rich programme of concerts, competitions between different Tunas and choirs, discussions of the university future and policies, etc.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.tagv.pt/#agenda=all">theatre agenda</a> is varied. Almost every night something is on. Even if you are not able to stay for a concert or performance, have a look at the temporary exhibition on the first floor, meet up your friends or stay to study at Caf&eacute;-Teatro.</p>

<p>Opened in 2008, <em>Teatro da Cerca de S&atilde;o Bernardo </em>(TCSB for short) is owned by the City Council, but managed and programmed by <em>Escola da Noite</em> - a Coimbra Theater Group, which articulates its own production with welcoming other artists, in particular in the area of theater and contemporary dance.</p>
<p>It is located in the historic center of the city and its construction was integrated into the requalification of the area of the <em>P&aacute;tio de Inquisi&ccedil;&atilde;o</em> near S&atilde;o Bernardo. It is today one of the main cultural hubs in Baixa.</p>

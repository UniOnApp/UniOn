<p>For movies and a bit of popcorn, head to the largest shopping centres. Their cinemas are open from 1pm to 1am, with up to ten different films being screened. Each session has an interval and opens with 20 mins of advertising and trailers.</p>
<p>On the movie poster, you will see the following information about age restrictions: &nbsp;</p>
<p>M6 - <em>maiores de 6 anos</em> (over 6 years old)</p>
<p>M12 - <em>maiores de 12 anos</em> (over 12 years old)</p>
<p>M16 - <em>maiores de 16 anos</em> (over 16 years old) &nbsp;</p>
<p>All foreign movies are usually subtitled (<em>filme</em> <em>legendado</em>). Children films (M6) come in two versions - they are normally dubbed in Portuguese (<em>dobrado</em>) and sometimes subtitled (<em>legendado</em>), with sessions starting after 9pm. </p>
<p>A standard ticket costs around &euro;7 and can be bought online (app and website) or at the cinema (kiosk and at the counter). Holders of student and European Youth cards pay less. Check online or ask at the counter for the complete listing of available discounts. Special combination rates apply on weekdays in both shopping centres: <em>cinema + refei&ccedil;&atilde;o</em> (film+meal after 7pm) is approximately &euro;8.</p>

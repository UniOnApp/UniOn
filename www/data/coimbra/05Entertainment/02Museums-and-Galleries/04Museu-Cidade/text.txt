<p>This museum is like no ordinary municipal museum: the magnificent downtown <em>Edif&iacute;cio Chiado</em> stands out with its unique wrought-iron lacework. You cannot miss it! After the inauguration in 1910 as a branch of Lisbon&rsquo;s <em>Grandes Armaz&eacute;ns do Chiado </em>(shopping galleries), it housed a factory, banks, and was almost abandoned. In the 1980s, partly thanks to the rumours of Gustave Eiffel&rsquo;s involvement in its construction, the building got finally renovated. It reopened as the city museum in 2001.</p>
<p>The ground floor is now used for temporary exhibitions. The upper three floors house a collection of Portuguese artists (late 19<sup>th</sup>-early 20<sup>th</sup> centuries) donated to Coimbra by medical doctor and philanthropist Jos&eacute; Carlos Telo de Morais. The fine arts collection is truly impressive and includes furniture, ceramic, paintings and sculpture.</p>
<p>The museum runs educational services for the district schools and plans theme guided visits of the city. </p>

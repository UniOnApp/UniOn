<p>The first university museum in Portugal was created during the Pombaline reforms and included the Natural History Cabinet, the Physics Cabinet, the anatomical theatre and the pharmaceutical dispensary. At other locations around the UC, the Laboratorio Chimico, the Astronomical Observatory and the Botanical Garden also contributed to the wealth of scientific knowledge.</p>
<p>The newly renovated Science Museum of the UC is an interactive museum for everyone that makes science educational and entertaining. Here you can, not only have a look at the scientific exhibits, but also take part in hands-on experiments and <a href="http://museudaciencia.inwebonline.net/">multimedia shows</a>, live and online.</p>
<p>Apart from the permanent exhibition &ldquo;Secrets of Light and Matter&rdquo; that recreates the history of science in Coimbra and in Portugal, the Museum is known for its temporary exhibitions, regular workshops, seminars and informal meetings with scientists. Everyone is welcome at the Museum, from experts to the curious, from the wise to the very young. </p>

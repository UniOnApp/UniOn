<p>This tower was part of the ancient city walls, and was known in medieval times as the Tower of the Prior of Ameal. The tower has changed little since the 16th century, and owes its present name to the Portuguese poet Ant&oacute;nio Nobre (1867-1900) who lived here in the late 19th century while studying Law at the University of Coimbra. Memories of his life and poetry are part of the exhibition &ldquo;<em>Mem&oacute;ria da escrita</em>&rdquo;. </p>
<p>Since July 2015, the Torre de Anto&nbsp;houses the &ldquo;<em>N&uacute;cleo da Guitarra e do Fado de Coimbra</em>&rdquo; (Centre of the Guitar and Fado of Coimbra), which is part of the Coimbra&rsquo;s City Museum that aims to disseminate the Coimbra Fado across the world.</p>

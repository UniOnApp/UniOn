<p>In 1911, the former bishop&rsquo;s palace of Coimbra, only much later classified as a National Museum, was taken over by the Portuguese state in order to house <a href="http://www.museumachadocastro.gov.pt/en-GB/default.aspx">Museu Machado de Castro</a>.</p>
<p>Redeveloped and enlarged at a very special moment in its history, the Museum reopened fully to the public 100 years after its foundation. In the new, spacious and light-filled galleries, you can see some of the finest examples of Portuguese monumental sculpture, an Oriental collection, fine jewellery, painting, drawing, ceramics, textiles, furniture. Don&rsquo;t miss the change of going for a stroll in the amazing and one of the best preserved <em>cryptoportico </em>in Europe, erected by the Roman administration in the 1<sup>st</sup> century, to support a building that became the political, administrative and religious centre of <em>Aeminium</em> - Roman Coimbra.</p>

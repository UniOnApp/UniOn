<p>Fancy some dancing? Then bars around Pra&ccedil;a da Rep&uacute;blica, Avenida S&aacute; da Bandeira and Celas are places to go (e.g. NB Club, States, Tweet and Avenue to name but a few bars). </p>
<p>The entertainment varies from bar to bar but usually includes a DJ session, cocktails and drinks, themed parties and sometimes dance workshops. Bars are open until 2 am, but when you feel like the night is still young, then head to Aqui Base Tango and Sal&atilde;o Brazil, which are open till 4 am. </p>

<p>Spring and summer are times for music festivals across Portugal: rock, pop, indie, world music or folk - you name it! Yet Coimbra has its own homegrown festivals with a long history, and recently has acquired a new one.</p>
<p><em>Sons da Cidade </em>(Sounds of the City) is a creation of the <em>Jazz ao Centro Clube</em> &nbsp;(JACC) with the support from the city council, UC, and the Central Portugal tourist office. For a week in May Coimbra lives and breathes jazz: masterclasses on improvisation are run in TAGV and Sal&atilde;o Brazil, jam sessions liven up the streets, and shows illuminate the Coimbra historic sites by night. What started off as an international musical exchange in 2003 has now become an emblematic event for the region.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In July, Coimbra is stage to&nbsp;<em>Festival das Artes</em>, organised by the <em>Funda&ccedil;&atilde;o In&ecirc;s de Castro</em>. It brings together music, arts, theatre, literature, cinema and photography in the dazzling outdoor amphitheatre at Quinta das L&aacute;grimas.</p>
<p><em>Festival (in)Comum: </em>indie music takes over the Coimbra downtown also in July with performances and sessions of the renowned and fledgling musicians and bands. Concerts and documentary screenings take place in most unusual places like traditional shops, in caf&eacute;s and hotel lobbies.</p>

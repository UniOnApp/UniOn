<p>Do you know that more than 25 different bands come from Coimbra? This town attracts some of the most creative and innovative musicians from across the country. </p>
<p><a href="https://myspace.com/brigadavictorjara">Brigada Victor Jara</a> formed after the Carnation Revolution: as part of their literacy campaign round the Beira Baixa province, musicians played protest and political songs from Chile and Portugal. Since then, they have performed in many countries including North Korea and Soviet Union. Brigada is still one of the most influential folk bands in Portugal. Solo projects emerged from it; for example, N&eacute; Ladeiras who recently collaborated with national and international artists like Chico C&eacute;sar and Ryuichi Sakamoto.</p>
<p>Portuguese music with its roots in folk, fado and religious songs has inspired recent projects like <em>Diabo a Sete</em>, <em>Pens&atilde;o Flor</em> and <em>Macadame</em>. <em>Diabo a Sete</em> incorporate traditional instruments like concertina, hurdy-gurdy, bagpipes, cavaquinho and mandolin. They won the national Eurofolk competition in 2006, and the Portuguese album of the year in 2011. <em>Pens&atilde;o Flor </em>(neofado) and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/osmacadame/">Macadame</a> (world music) share the unique voice of their lead singer, the talented V&acirc;nia Couto.</p>
<p>Coimbra's not only about fado. There are many spaces for alternative music movements. RUC has made way for projects in electronic music and indie rock, punk and rockabilly.</p>
<p>Joey Ramone, the punk legend, once said that the Coimbra&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nZW5vvU7-1U">T&eacute;dio Boys </a>were the world&rsquo;s best punk band! Punk, rockabilly and psychobilly stand strong with Sean Riley and the Slowriders, Bunnyranch, Wraygunn, Belle Chase Hotel, The Legendary Tigerman, Voodoo Dolls, Tiguana Bibles and many others. Paulo Furtado, aka Tigerman, who sung and played guitar in some of those bands, has also been one of the most successful one-man shows in Coimbra history. </p>
<p>Some of the most successful and highly charismatic indie bands from Coimbra are <a href="https://birdsareindie.bandcamp.com/">Birds are Indie</a> and <a href="https://myspace.com/anaquim.info/photos">Anaquim</a>. Their lyrics are always ironic, their music is a mix of the French chanson, the Balkan songs, and the Portuguese traditional music. </p>
<p>Despite touring around the country, the Coimbra rock bands always return to the homebase to give concerts at Noites do Parque for Queima and Latada. Come and have a blast of a time!</p>

<p><strong>Jos&eacute; Ant&oacute;nio Carlos de Seixas</strong>&nbsp;or just <strong>Carlos Seixas</strong> was a notable Portuguese <a href="https://youtu.be/aOocxj4bEO4">composer</a> of the 18<sup>th</sup> century, born in Coimbra. </p>
<p>Immersed in music from a young age, he succeeded his father as S&eacute; Nova cathedral organist when he was only 14! Two years after, in 1720, he moved to&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisbon">Lisbon</a>&nbsp;to take up his new position&nbsp;as court organist and harpsichordist. Seixas&rsquo; keyboard works were written for a variety of instruments, including the organ, harpsichord, and the clavichord. Many of his scores were destroyed in the 1755 Lisbon earthquake, yet around 100 different musical pieces survived to our delight. </p>
<p><strong>Jos&eacute; Afonso</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Zeca Afonso</strong>&nbsp;or just&nbsp;<strong>Zeca,</strong> is one of the most influential folk and, political musicians in Portuguese history. He became an icon due to <a href="https://youtu.be/gaLWqy4e7ls">the role of his music</a> in the resistance against the dictatorial regime of&nbsp;Salazar, resistance that triumphed in 1974 with the pro-democratic military coup of the&nbsp;Carnation Revolution. </p>
<p>Born in Aveiro, he came to Coimbra in 1940 to continue his studies. In 1949 he started studying&nbsp;History&nbsp;and&nbsp;Philosophy&nbsp;at UC. As a student, he travelled with some of the most important university musical groups, as&nbsp;Orfeon Acad&eacute;mico de Coimbra, and played football for AAC.</p>

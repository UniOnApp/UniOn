<p>A city bustling with energy, Coimbra is open to all things creative and alternative. Yet it&rsquo;s impossible to think of just ONE place! </p>
<p>If we were to make a survey among UC students, they would probably say <a href="http://salaobrazil.blogspot.pt/p/sobre-o-salao.html">Sal&atilde;o Brazil</a>, where you can listen to live jazz, electronic, folk and indie music while having a beer or a meal. But it&rsquo;s not only about concerts: art exhibitions, poetry slam performances and different cultural workshops are regularly organized at Sal&atilde;o. For those who like a good old quiz, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/AquiBaseTango/">Aqui Base Tango</a> runs quiz Tuesdays starting at 10 pm. </p>
<p><a href="http://www.condominiocriativo.pt/">Condom&iacute;nio Criativo</a> at Casa das Artes Bissaya Barreto has proven its name by running a rich agenda around the week, from DJ Matin&eacute;es, film screenings, yoga and dance workshops, travellers&rsquo; talks, to boardgames and vegetarian lunches. </p>
<p>Check out events round the year by <a href="http://prettysongsdontlie.blogspot.pt/p/english.html">Lugar Comum</a> for indie rock and folk performances, showcases, documentaries and festivals.</p>

<p>There are three major mobile phone service providers in Portugal:&nbsp;<a href="http://www.vodafone.pt">Vodafone</a><strong>,&nbsp;</strong><a href="http://www.nos.pt">NOS</a> and&nbsp;<a href="http://www.meo.pt">MEO</a>.</p>
<p>Each provider offers a variety of prepaid&nbsp;<em>(Pr&eacute;-Pagos)</em>&nbsp;and contract&nbsp;<em>(p&oacute;s-pagos)&nbsp;</em>SIM cards, both of which are available to foreigners.</p>
<p>To get a prepaid SIM card you should go to one of the network provider's shops. There you will be asked for your name and address. No proof of address is required.</p>
<p>Getting a contract<em>&nbsp;</em>SIM card is easy, but you will need a Portuguese tax number to apply for a mobile contract. You will also need to bring along your passport or ID card and a Proof of address (bank statement or utility bill).</p>
<p>Payments for contracts can be made in the same way as for prepaid phones. However, there is the option of setting-up a Direct Debit.</p>

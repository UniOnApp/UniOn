<p>Your UC student card is linked to <strong>Santander Totta</strong> bank and will give you the <a href="https://portal.sibscartoes.pt/Fichas/index/card/rwcb/id/00033/formtype/rnc">option of opening a bank account</a> in an easy and hassle-free manner. You can find the university branch in Polo I, at the ground floor of the Physics Department.</p>
<p>If you choose to open an account with another bank, you must be over 18 and provide proof of identity (passport or national ID card), proof of your address in Portugal (a recent utility bill or rental contract) and your fiscal/tax number. A standard Portuguese bank account for day-to-day banking is called &lsquo;<em>Conta corrente</em>&rsquo; (Current Account). Most current accounts are free but some banks may charge fees and stipulate that a minimum deposit needs to be paid into the account, so be sure to check that out.</p>

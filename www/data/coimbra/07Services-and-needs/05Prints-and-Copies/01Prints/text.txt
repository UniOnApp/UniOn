<p>If you need to print an essay, your thesis or a conference poster with good quality, go professional. There are plenty of places to choose from, and you can be sure to be happy with the final result. For simple requests (black and white A4 or A3 printing in the usual 80gr white paper), any copying/printing/binding service will do the job. But if you have special requirements, try the <em>Reprografia</em> at DARQ (Architecture Department), in Col&eacute;gio das Artes, Polo I of UC.</p>

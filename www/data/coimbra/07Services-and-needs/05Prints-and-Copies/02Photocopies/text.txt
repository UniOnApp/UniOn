<p>University education is often inseparable from photocopies: from private notes but also from scientific books. The first option is allowed, but the second can violate the Copyright, consecrated constitutionally. Illegal copies are, unfortunately for authors and publishers, a worldwide reality that is hardly quantifiable. Please be aware of this, but rest assured that you can photocopy up to 30% of a book for your private use only.</p>
<p>Every faculty or department has its own copying, printing and binding service, with student friendly prices, and in Polo I campus, you also have at your disposal Drag &amp; Print kiosks (AAC study room and canteen A) to download or print directly from your personal cloud.</p>

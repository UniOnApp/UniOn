<p>Once you've secured a place at the UC, you can start looking for accommodation in Coimbra. Some prefer to book a room at a hotel or a hostel first, get a feel of the city and then go on the house hunt.</p>
<p>If you don't mind sharing your quarters with other people, you can apply beforehand for a place at one of the international student residences. Alternatively, once in Coimbra, you can try and stay at one of the student <em>Rep&uacute;blicas, </em>which are entirely student-run and quite affordable (even though difficult to enter for the outsiders).</p>
<p>The UC student union (AAC) has an accommodation <a href="http://academica.pt/acao-social/">section</a> where you can ask for a list of AAC certified rooms. AAC also runs a social housing project called <em>"Lado a Lado" (Side by side)</em> where students are housed with senior citizens.</p>
<p>There are usually many options to choose from. Keep your cool, look around you and take notice of ads pasted on windows and street posts, and put up in local newspapers. Take a Portuguese-speaking friend along for house-seeing/shopping around. Get a group of friends together to share a flat. Do not forget to ask about utility bills (whether they are included into the room rate) and about heating (as it gets cold in winter).&nbsp;</p>

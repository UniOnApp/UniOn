<p>Unlike in the USA, you won't find common washing machines in the basements of houses in Coimbra. However, UC residences and <em>Rep&uacute;blicas </em>usually do have washing machines for common use, and many owners of shared flats also provide washing machines/dryers for the tenants to use. Sometimes the machines are installed on the closed-off balconies.</p>
<p>If your flat or room does not have a washing machine, not to worry: self-service laundromats (<em>lavandaria self-service</em>) are available across the city. The closest to Polo I is SASUC lavandaria self-service at the bottom of <em>Escadas Monumentais.</em> Their rates are also the cheapest. The SASUC laundromat is equipped with several industrial washing machines and dryers (6,5kg capacity), so you can load anything from a jacket to a blanket. Washing liquids/powder and conditioners are included. As a bonus, in the same building you can have your clothes pressed, repaired or/and sewn.</p>
<p>The SASUC laundromat is open on weekdays, 8 to 5pm. Other places around the city (e.g. in Rua da Alegria, in Celas, near Coimbra Shopping) can be open till late and over the weekend.</p>

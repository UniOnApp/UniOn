<p>SASUC - <em>Servi&ccedil;os de A&ccedil;&atilde;o Social da Universidade de Coimbra </em>(UC welfare services) - act in many areas of the university community life, from providing meals on the campus to healthcare and accommodation.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>International mobility students are usually housed in three university <a href="http://www.uc.pt/en/sasuc/Quick_search/CP3_Accommodation">residences</a>, one in each of the UC campuses. One of them (Rua do Teodoro) is only for female students from the different schools and departments; and the one in Polo II admits both male and female students from the engineering schools.</p>
<p>There are single and double rooms at the UC residences, with monthly rates varying from &euro;120 to &euro;270 (incl. bed linen, blankets and towels). All of them have access to fully equipped kitchens, lounges and wi-fi access, and are regularly serviced. To apply for a place in one of the residences, please fill the provided <a href="https://portaldossas.uc.pt/meuprocesso/">form</a>.</p>

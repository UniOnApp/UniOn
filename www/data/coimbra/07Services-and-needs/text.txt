<p>The University of Coimbra campus is a town in itself, where you can find almost everything you need day-to-day. Photocopy and print out study resources, open a bank account and withdraw money from it, buy train tickets, make medical appointments and have tests taken, fill your medical prescriptions, post a letter and receive a parcel, wash, dry and repair your clothes &ndash; all of it can be taken care of practically without leaving UC&rsquo;s main campus.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So stay safe and healthy!</p>

<p>With one of the largest international student communities in Portugal, the University of Coimbra seeks to help new students to settle soon, receive information and resolve issues with international documents (student visas, residency permits, etc.) as close to the uni as possible. That is why the frontdesk of <a href="http://www.sef.pt/portal/V10/EN/aspx/page.aspx"><em>Servi&ccedil;o de Estrangeiros e Fronteiras</em></a> (SEF) was opened in 2014 at Casa da Lusofonia. The Portuguese passports are also issued here for the teaching and research staff. The immigration service frontdesk works on Tuesdays and Thursdays (9h30-13h; 14h-17h30). You can book your appointment at SEF <a href="http://www.sef.pt/portal/v10/EN/aspx/marcacao/index.aspx">online</a>.

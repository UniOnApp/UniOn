<p>Before coming to Portugal, make sure you get the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/social/main.jsp?catId=559&amp;langId=en">European Health Insurance Card</a>. With this card, you can access all the healthcare services available for the Portuguese citizens, from medical appointments and tests to hospitalisation. Students from non-EU countries need to acquire the European coverage insurance (make inquiries at the internationalisation unit of your university). </p>
<p>Make sure you register in the health centre (<em>centro de sa&uacute;de</em>) nearby your home in Coimbra. For check-ups, make an appointment at the UC medical services or at your health centre. Centres are open 8am-8pm on weekdays, and until 1pm on Saturdays. Here you can see a nurse to have your vaccines, injections, to change your dressings, and to take your weight, height, and blood pressure. A general practitioner will examine your health state and will prescribe treatments or will refer you for further screening or to a specialist. Medical samples and exams are taken and analysed outside health centres at specialist offices like "<em>laborat&oacute;rios de an&aacute;lises cl&iacute;nicas</em>" and <em>centros de exames m&eacute;dicos</em>. </p>
<p>For after-hours calls or in case of emergency, go to the University Hospitals in Celas <em>(CHUC-Centro Hospitalar Universit&aacute;rio da Universidade de Coimbra</em>). The priority of treatment is determined through the Manchester Triage System (5 colours: red-orange-yellow-green-blue), so that patients in the most critical condition are attributed a red tag and are the first to be admitted.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Whenever you feel uncertain yet extremely worried about your state you can sort out questions and doubts over the phone: use <em>Sa&uacute;de 24</em>: tel. 808 24 24 24 (free of charge). If your symptoms are serious, you will be referred to the nearest hospital.</p>
<p>Finally, money matters: make sure you have some money on you as administration fees can apply.&nbsp;</p>

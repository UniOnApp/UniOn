<p>Coimbra is a city with a leisurely attitude to active lifestyle. Its hilly streets may be challenging for cyclists and runners, and it isn't likely to find anyone in the historic centre riding gyro scooters. Yet at weekends and on weekday evenings, Coimbra parks, stadiums and sports grounds fill up with groups of people running, power walking, playing football, basketball and tennis. Heading to a gym or to a swimming pool before or after classes/work is becoming increasingly popular. The university campuses have recently installed bike racks. The students' union (AAC) provides affordable ways of keeping fit on different locations across the city.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For the outdoorsy types, the Coimbra area has a lot to offer. Once navigable, the Mondego river is good for rowing, kayaking, yachting and standup paddle boarding. Hikers and mountaineers can join local groups and follow one of the <a href="http://solagasta.com/en/">trails</a> in Lous&atilde;, Penela or Penacova. For those who prefer a more relaxed lifestyle, there are plenty of opportunities for walking and meditating to the sound of ocean waves or in-sync with nature.</p>

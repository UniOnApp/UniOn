<p><em>Est&aacute;dio Cidade de Coimbra</em> belongs to the city and is mainly used by <em>Acad&eacute;mica</em>, Coimbra's&nbsp;football&nbsp;team. With 29,622 seats, two-thirds of which are covered, the complex has a large press center, a bar and a restaurant with a panoramic view over the pitch.</p>
<p>The stadium's new and contemporary look was achieved after it was rebuilt, expanded, and modernized to host some&nbsp;UEFA Euro 2004&nbsp;matches. The existing athletic tracks were preserved for future use. The stadium has also been part of world tours by international rock and pop stars like U2, Madonna and the Rolling Stones.</p>
<p>A multi-purpose pavilion, Olympic swimming pools, health club, gym, offices and studio apartment residences were built in the surrounding area. Next to the stadium is Alma, a shopping and leisure center with cinemas, underground free car parking and restaurants.</p>

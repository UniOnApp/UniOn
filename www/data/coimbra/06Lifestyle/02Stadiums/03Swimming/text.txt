<p>In Coimbra, fans of swimming and water sports have lots of places to choose from: they can go for a swim/paddle to the river beach or take a train to the ocean side in Figueira da Foz. Weather and water temperature permitting, the swimming season on the Mondego river and on the ocean side is usually open between May and October. </p>
<p>Throughout the year, you can do laps, strokes and diving in several swimming pools across Coimbra. Not very far from the UC campus (Polo I) are the <em>Piscina Municipal de Celas</em> and the <em>Complexo Ol&iacute;mpico de Piscinas, </em>which are open daily except on Sundays. The new modern 50m long <a href="https://www.cm-coimbra.pt/index.php/equipamentos-menu-desporto-350/286-heris-do-ultramar">Complexo Ol&iacute;mpico de Piscinas</a> at Solum has 10 lanes, while the pool in <a href="https://www.cm-coimbra.pt/index.php/areas-de-intervencao/desporto/equipamentos/item/3219-piscinas-municipais-de-celas">Celas</a> is smaller (25m with 6 lanes). Anything from competitive sports to leisure water activities &ndash; namely, hydrogymnastics, hydrobike, water polo, synchronised swimming, springboard diving, etc. - can be practiced there. You can always find at least two lanes kept for public use.&nbsp;</p>

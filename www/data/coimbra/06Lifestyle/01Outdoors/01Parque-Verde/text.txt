<p>Parque Verde is a large green area next to Parque da Cidade on the right bank of the Mondego. It includes 4kms of pedestrian and cycle pathways, a children's playground, thematic exhibition pavilions and the <em>Pavilh&atilde;o Centro Portugal</em> (Central Pavilion of Portugal), designed by architects Souto Moura and &Aacute;lvaro Siza Vieira. It also has a large terrace area set on a wooden platform over the river.</p>
<p>On the left bank of the river there is a sandbox for beach volleyball, a basic level skate-park, several children's amusement facilities, outdoor gym workout equipment, a picnic area and four pavilions for nautical activities. If you fancy a boat ride there are inflatables, canoes, paddle boats and even a <em>barca serrana</em>, (traditional boat that used to transport the clothes of the <em>lavadeiras</em> &ndash; washerwomen - along the Mondego) to choose from.</p>
<p>Connecting the left and right banks of the Mondego is <em>Ponte Pedonal Pedro e In&ecirc;s</em> (Pedestrian Bridge Pedro and In&ecirc;s), an asymmetrical structure that is an icon of architecture and technical innovation. This pedestrian bridge features a wooden walkway with protective glass guards in four colours. In the centre of the bridge, an original square, eight meters wide, is the perfect spot for a photo!</p>

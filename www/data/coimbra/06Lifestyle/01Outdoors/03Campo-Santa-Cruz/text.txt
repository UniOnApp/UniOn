<p>The mythical Campo de Santa Cruz was, since February 1918 to the 1960s, the sports ground for the students of the Coimbra Academy.</p>
<p>It was used for many sports, from football to rugby, including athletics, basketball, roller hockey, handball, volleyball and baseball, among others.</p>
<p>Campo de Santa Cruz contributed decisively to the promotion of the sports practice of students of the University of Coimbra. Yet it started to deteriorate in the 1960s due to the lack of maintenance, to the construction of the University Stadium of Coimbra and also to the political indecision about its future.</p>
<p>In 2001, Campo de Santa Cruz started to be remodelled and improved, with a project by the architect Jos&eacute; Cabral. The works finished in 2008 and the "new" Campo de Santa Cruz was inaugurated on October 18<sup>th</sup>.</p>
<p>This emblematic space is available for <a href="http://www.uc.pt/governo/reitoria/csc/DisponibilidadeReservas">booking</a> and hosts a large variety of sports.</p>
<p>Fun fact: the renovation works had to be interrupted until a housing solution was found to suit a colony of common midwife toads, discovered completely by accident!</p>

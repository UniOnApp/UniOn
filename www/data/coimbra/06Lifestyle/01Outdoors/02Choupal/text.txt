<p><em>Mata Nacional do Choupal</em> (Choupal National Forest) is just a short distance from the city downtown and runs alongside the&nbsp;Mondego River.</p>
<p>This grove of&nbsp;poplar&nbsp;trees (<em>choupos</em>, whence&nbsp;<em>choupal</em>&nbsp;"poplar grove") was planted in an attempt to stop the floods of the Mondego. In 1791, the engineer and priest, Est&ecirc;v&atilde;o Cabral directed a big project to decrease the levels of&nbsp;silt&nbsp;in the river, so the trees of Choupal were planted to allow a better settling of the&nbsp;riverbed.</p>
<p>Since the 19<sup>th</sup> century, many other trees including sycamores, beeches, laurels and eucalyptus have grown in the area. Today the forest is a popular place for recreation and exercise. It has trails for jogging, walking, cycling and horse riding, and a&nbsp;picnic area. If you are into basketball, tennis or badminton, you can also practice them here: there are regular games.</p>

<p><em>Largo da Porta F&eacute;rrea</em> is the official entrance to the Old University. Its 17th century heavy iron gates are like a portal that transports you from one era to another, from the Estado Novo buildings to the 16th century <em>Pa&ccedil;o das Escolas</em>. The huge emblem of the University of Coimbra - Wisdom - made out of two-shade cobbles (<em>cal&ccedil;ada portuguesa) </em>crowns this entrance. If you are facing the representation of Wisdom, then the School of Arts and Humanities is on your right, and the Biblioteca Geral and tourist office is on your left.</p>
<p>As an icon of the UC, <em>Porta F&eacute;rrea</em> is also a door into the world of ancient rites of the academic community and has seen various kinds of political action: for instance, the <em>Associa&ccedil;&atilde;o Acad&eacute;mica</em> representatives have attempted to chain the iron gate as a sign of protest against rising fees. </p>

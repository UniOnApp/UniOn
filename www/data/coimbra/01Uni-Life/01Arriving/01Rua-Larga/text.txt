<p>This Coimbra street runs along the University main campus from one king to another. On one end, the statue of the University founder Dom Dinis on Largo Dom Dinis, and on the other end, the statue of Dom Jo&atilde;o III whose royal palace hosted the first university schools. Follow this direction, leaving behind Escadas Monumentais. Pass by the Departamento de Matem&aacute;tica on your left and the Col&eacute;gio S&atilde;o Jer&oacute;nimo on your right and you are in Rua Larga. As you walk in between the Departamento de Qu&iacute;mica and F&iacute;sica on the one side, and the School of Medicine on the other, you are heading towards Largo de Porta F&eacute;rrea.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Rua Larga is pedestrian, with traffic restricted to night hours and public transport. Hop onto the Electric Tuk-Tuk for a little tour of the historic city centre.</p>
<p>This broad street plays an important role in student celebrations. Queima das Fitas and Latada parades start off with a drum roll and a bagpipe down Rua Larga, marking the end and the beginning of the school year. </p>

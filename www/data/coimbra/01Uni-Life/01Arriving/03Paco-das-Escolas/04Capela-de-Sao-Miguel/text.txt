<p>Capela de S&atilde;o Miguel replaced a small private chapel of the royal palace, probably dated from the 12<sup>th</sup> century. One of its treasures is a baroque organ ornamented with Chinese motifs, mounted according to monastic traditions (back in the 16<sup>th</sup> century study meant reclusion).&nbsp; The chapel is site for catholic rites, like Sunday masses, weddings, and funeral services. Organ and choral concerts are held here as well.</p>

<p>&ldquo;<em>Pa&ccedil;o</em>&rdquo; means &ldquo;palace&rdquo;, where university and royalty go hand in hand. <a href="http://worldheritage.uc.pt/pt">The first Portuguese university</a> spread from here in 1544, and nowadays it is one of the traces of the Old University of Coimbra. King Dom Jo&atilde;o III&rsquo;s royal palace housed the first university buildings. The statue of the king himself is standing in the square to greet you.</p>
<p>Pa&ccedil;o das Escolas brings together study and research, religion and imperial past, culture and heritage. It is lined with the most iconic buildings of Coimbra: Via Latina, Torre da Universidade, Capela de S&atilde;o Miguel, and its gem - <em>Biblioteca Joanina</em>. Pa&ccedil;o das Escolas is not stuck in the past: it has been stage to fado concerts, theatrical and video mapping performances. </p>

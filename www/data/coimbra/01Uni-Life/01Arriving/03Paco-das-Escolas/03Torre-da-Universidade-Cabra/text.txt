<p>Torre da Universidade, or <em>Cabra</em>, as it is known across the university, can be seen from afar and is part of the cityline. Its bells used to mark the start and the end of the student day: no<em> caloiro</em> could be seen in Coimbra streets once the day&rsquo;s last bell tolled. Even today, once you hear the bell, students and professors have 15 minutes to get to their classes. It is called <em>&ldquo;quarto de hora acad&eacute;mico&rdquo;</em>.</p>
<p>Nowadays Torre da Universidade offers the best panoramic view towards the Mondego river and Santa Clara on the left bank. </p>

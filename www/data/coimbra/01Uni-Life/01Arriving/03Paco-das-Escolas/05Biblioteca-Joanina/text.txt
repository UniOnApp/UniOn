<p>Biblioteca Joanina is listed among the most beautiful libraries of the world. Go inside and let it overwhelm you. Slowly take in the magnificent painted ceilings, the elegant balustrades covered with gilt, and the wide tables of precious wood brought from the Portuguese former colonies. Unusual night caretakers guard thousands of invaluable books - bat colonies eat bugs to protect their pages from decay.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to feel awe and respect before the imperial opulence of the library, especially if you are a Coimbra student. Yet the library has a grim side to it: pass through a tiny side door and you can visit the quarters of academic prison.</p>

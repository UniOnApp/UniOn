<p>Escadas Monumentais - or <em>As Monumentais</em> as everyone calls them - connect Alta/ Largo Dom Dinis to the city centre: Pra&ccedil;a da Rep&uacute;blica, Teatro Gil Vicente, Pastelaria Universidade, taxi and bus stops. </p>
<p>Lots of people go up and down <em>As Monumentais</em> at least twice a day.&nbsp; After a hearty lunch in one of the <em>cantinas universit&aacute;rias</em> at the bottom of the stairs, you can lose some calories as you &lsquo;climb&rsquo; the 125 steps on a hot summer day. Picture eager athletes using them as an outdoor gym! </p>
<p><em>As Monumentais</em> have their own urban legends: the five landings remind the student of the number of years in the <em>licenciatura pr&eacute;-Bolonha</em>, while the number of times you trip as you go up the steps represents the number of times you&rsquo;ll fail exams in the current school year. There are others - find them!</p>
<p><em>As Monumentais</em> are a great meetup for friends and a sunbed as you sit together on one of the five landings and take a break from the university rush. </p>
<p><em>As Monumentais</em> are often space for cultural and political activities: concert ground, stage for poetic performance, site for student protest, street art, ads and posters, electoral campaigns or social movements. So don&rsquo;t be surprised if you are handed a leaflet or asked to take part in a survey while heading to its top. </p>

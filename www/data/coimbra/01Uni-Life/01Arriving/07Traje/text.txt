<p>The Academic Outfit <em>(Traje Acad&eacute;mico)</em> is an iconic symbol of university life. Nowadays, it&rsquo;s up to the student to wear it or not. Yet it is a compulsory requirement for praxe.</p>
<p>In UC, both men and women dress in black from head to toe and cover it with a black cloak. Tradition says that the cloak should never be washed before the student&rsquo;s graduation, so as not to erase any of the significant moments of academic life. When you finally graduate from the University, <em>traje acad&eacute;mico </em>will be literally ripped apart by a small friendly crowd in a symbolical ceremony called <em>Rasgan&ccedil;o</em>. </p>
<p>The outfit takes us back in time as it recalls clergymen&rsquo;s past influence on university life. It may even remind you of J. K. Rowling&rsquo;s Hogwarts cloaks.</p>
<p>Still, one very useful object can be worn separately from the academic outfit - a black leather folder divided in pockets with space for all your notes and knick-knacks.</p>

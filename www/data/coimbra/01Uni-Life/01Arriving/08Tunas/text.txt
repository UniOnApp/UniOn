<p>A <em>Tuna</em> is, nowadays, a group of university students in their academic outfits (usually all male or all female) who play traditional instruments and sing serenades. In a Portuguese tuna, there are at least two basic instruments: the guitar and the tambourine, but other instruments like mandolin are also played.</p>
<p>The tradition comes from the 13<sup>th</sup> century Spain and Portugal, to help poor students earn money or food. Nowadays, students join a "Tuna" to keep the tradition alive for fun and travel.</p>

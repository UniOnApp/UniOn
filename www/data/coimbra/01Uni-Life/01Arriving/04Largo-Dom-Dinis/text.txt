<p>The statue of the university&rsquo;s founder, King Dom Dinis, marks the highest spot in <em>Alta universit&aacute;ria, </em>greeting whoever goes up Escadas Monumentais. </p>
<p>Largo Dom Dinis is one of the favourite meeting points for tourists and the university community - all the roads across the university&rsquo; main campus (Polo I) converge here at the statue&rsquo;s foot. That is why all student parades flow past the square. Here, you can often see praxe activities: <em>caloiros</em> chanting, singing and marching under the watchful eye of their <em>padrinhos</em>. </p>
<p>Yet in the past this square was linked to some historic moments of the 1969 crise acad&eacute;mica, when the square and the Departamento de Matem&aacute;tica were occupied by protesting students and AAC leaders.&nbsp;</p>

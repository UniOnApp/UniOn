<p>UC new students&rsquo; homecoming week is <em>Rece&ccedil;&atilde;o ao Caloiro </em>aka<em> Semana da Latada. </em>It takes place in October and starts with a moving, solemn midnight&nbsp;<em>Serenata</em>,<em> fado</em> on the stairs of S&eacute; Nova, sung to an impressive crowd of students, tourists and onlookers. Concerts and events fill the following five days. It ends with a wacky street parade - <em>Festa das Latas</em>&nbsp;(Festival of Cans) aka&nbsp;<em>Latada,</em> where freshmen wearing fun outfits tie cans to their legs while being led by older students. This loud and colourful celebration goes back to the 19<sup>th</sup> century, when Law students used cans to show their joy at finishing another academic year. </p>
<p>Speak of going off with a bang, right?</p>
<p>In May, Portuguese universities shake up city streets with another week of celebration. The oldest and most vibrant festival is in Coimbra. &nbsp;<em>Queima das Fitas</em> celebrates students' graduation by burning their faculty ribbons (<em>fitas das faculdades</em>).&nbsp;<em>Queima</em>&rsquo;s highlight is <em>Cortejo - </em>a lively parade from&nbsp;Rua Larga down to Coimbra shopping streets of&nbsp;Baixa. Floats with paper flowers in each faculty colours carry banners with sarcastic messages on the current state of affairs in politics and education. </p>
<p>The city streets get awash with beer, throbbing with music, dance and partying. Every night, different national and international bands shake up the crowd.<em> Queima</em> finishes with a fireworks display by the Mondego riverside. The whole city does not sleep during Latada and Queima! These weeks are great for making new friends.</p>

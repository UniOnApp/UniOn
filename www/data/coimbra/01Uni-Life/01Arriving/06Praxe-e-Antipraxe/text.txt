<p>Each academic year starts with the new students&rsquo; noisy and lively initiation rituals, or <em>Praxe</em> in Portuguese.&nbsp;<em>Praxe </em>aims to introduce freshmen to a singular side of university life. From their second year on, students can welcome newcomers by making them face situations where they need to think outside the box. To protect new students and avoid less appropriate or even humiliating moments during the initiation, student unions (<em>Associa&ccedil;&otilde;es Acad&eacute;micas)</em> monitor <em>Praxe</em>.</p>
<p>If you do not want to be part of these traditions, it is important to state you are &lsquo;anti-praxe&rsquo;, to avoid peer pressure.</p>

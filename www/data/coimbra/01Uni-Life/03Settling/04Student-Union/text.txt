<p><em>Associa&ccedil;&atilde;o Acad&eacute;mica de Coimbra</em>, <em>AAC</em> for short, is the students&rsquo; union of the University of Coimbra. Standing in front of its 1961 building, it&rsquo;s hard to imagine that AAC is the oldest students&rsquo; union in Portugal, founded in 1887. <em>AAC</em> has been instrumental in Portugal&acute;s modern history: some of the most prominent Portuguese politicians shaped their political views here.</p>
<p>Students of every <em>Faculdade</em> are represented by one of the <em>N&uacute;cleos de Estudantes</em> in the university senate. With its own helpline (<em>SOS estudante</em>), study room, accommodation and support services, <em>AAC</em> helps newcomers to fit in, to find affordable lodgings, as well as to understand how studying and exams work at the UC. Students have their own theatre groups, debate societies, music ensembles, choirs, and <em>fado</em> groups. They run an amateur radio station (<em>RUC</em>), known for its alternative vibe, and a newspaper called <em>A Cabra</em>. Athletes of the <em>Acad&eacute;mica</em>&rsquo;s sports clubs in football, rugby, rowing, swimming, and martial arts compete in national and international events. </p>
<p>If you need help with anything during your stay at the UC, if you want to try out something new, come along, have a cup of coffee at the bar and see what&rsquo;s there for you.</p>

<p>When you&rsquo;ve learned your first words in Portuguese, you may be surprised to realise that <em>servi&ccedil;os acad&eacute;micos</em> at Polo I are located in <em>Pal&aacute;cio dos Grilos</em> (Crickets&rsquo; Palace) on <em>Rua da Ilha</em> (Island Street), next to <em>Pal&aacute;cios Confusos </em>(Confused Palaces). What do crickets have to do with this baroque building? Not much, apparently, as it used to belong to the religious order of Discalced Friars of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_Saint_Augustine">Order of Saint Augustine</a>, which came from Spain in the 17<sup>th</sup> century and first settled at Lugar do Grilo (Cricket&rsquo;s place) in Lisbon. From that moment on, the brothers were known as <em>irm&atilde;os grilos</em> in Portugal. </p>
<p>As for the &ldquo;islands&rdquo; and &ldquo;confusing palaces&rdquo; in the Coimbra historic centre, their names are down to the city inhabitants&rsquo; sense of humour. The &lsquo;Island&rsquo; alludes to the street being compactly surrounded by houses, while Pal&aacute;cios Confusos refers to the very confusing landscape those houses form.</p>

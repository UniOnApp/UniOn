<p>In Coimbra, there are now more than two dozens of <em>Rep&uacute;blicas.</em> Much like sororities, fraternities or other student societies, these student-run lodgings have a long-lasting tradition of offering alternative ways of university life. As UC students, all tenants are considered house owners, making them equally responsible for decision-making and democratic management of the common property.</p>
<p><em>Rep&uacute;blicas</em> go back to the 14<sup>th</sup> century. King Dom Dinis ordained the construction of student housing in the historic downtown (Almedina) and appointed a commission of students and "good men" of the city to jointly manage the property. Students had to pay a rent established by the citizens&rsquo; commission, helping students stay within their budgets. Even today, students in Rep&uacute;blicas live by democratic values ​​that link past and present. They learn to be part of community life, to become responsible for common goods, to be self-reliant and autonomous. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.uc.pt/casadalusofonia/isl">Casa da Lusofonia</a> is the first place to go in Coimbra. It combines student services with student association activities. As an incoming mobility/international student, you have to sort out issues about your mobility plan here during the morning office hours (9:30 am-2 pm). The afternoon is reserved for outgoing UC students. </p>
<p>After the office hours, Casa da Lusofonia becomes a place where mobility students meet up, get together and take part in cultural activities - workshops, seminars, roundtables and exhibitions. Some of them are promoted by Erasmus Network or&nbsp; by organisations of students from countries with Portuguese as one of the official languages.</p>

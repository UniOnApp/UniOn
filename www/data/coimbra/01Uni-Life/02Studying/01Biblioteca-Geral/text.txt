<p><em>Biblioteca Geral</em> is open to the wide public. To access its catalogue, all you need is valid ID. You can work in the library&rsquo;s vast reading room from 9 am - 12.30/ 2 pm - 10 pm. Library and information services include the use of online/main catalogues, a multimedia room and photocopying (with some restrictions), interlibrary loan, as well as help with bibliography research. You can even access its incredible digital archive of rare editions, which includes the Lus&iacute;adas, first published in 1584. </p>
<p>Biblioteca Geral is not specialised in any particular subject. As a copyright library, it is home to every single book, journal or atlas printed out in Portugal since 1932. </p>
<p>Coimbra university students and general public went to read and study at this library since the 16th century, then called <em>Livraria do Estudo</em>. Here started the School of Arts and Humanities (<em>Faculdade de Letras</em>) in the 19th century. On this site, books, arts and letters have always gone hand in hand. The 1950s buildings for Faculdade de Letras and Biblioteca Geral follow the Estado Novo architectural style. In front, seven monumental sculptures celebrating knowledge and Liberal Arts seem to be chatting away across Largo da Porta F&eacute;rrea. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The university tourist office is located in the <a href="http://www.uc.pt/en/bguc">Biblioteca Geral</a> lobby, where you can get tickets (free for UC students) to visit the Old University of Coimbra and Biblioteca Joanina.</p>

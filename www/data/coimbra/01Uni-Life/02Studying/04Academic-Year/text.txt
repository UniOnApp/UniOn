<p>The academic year opens with a traditional ceremony called <em>Abertura Solene</em> <em>das Aulas</em> in Sala dos Capelos, consisting of three speeches. First, <em>discurso do Reitor</em>, then <em>Ora&ccedil;&atilde;o de Sapi&ecirc;ncia, </em>given by a UC Professor, and finally a speech by the student union (AAC) president. </p>
<p>The academic year is divided in two semesters and classes run from mid-September to mid-December. Second semester starts off in February and ends in May. </p>
<p>Student festivities also shape the academic year. In October, <em>Festa das Latas</em> (<em>Latada</em>) mark student admissions to the university. The newly arrived students wear empty cans and tins (<em>latas</em>) to make a noisy entrance at the students&rsquo; parade. In May, before the examination period, another student celebration that starts with a ritual of burning ribbons - <em>Queima das Fitas </em>- announces the end of the academic year. </p>
<p>Both students festivities open with a fado serenade (<em>Serenata</em>) performed by the university students. During a whole week, the city vibrates with music performances, sport and other cultural activities.</p>

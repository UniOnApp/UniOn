<p>Your <em>plano de estudos </em>(student plan) includes compulsory (<em>unidade curricular obrigat&oacute;ria</em>) and optional (<em>unidade curricular opcional)</em> modules. If you want to study something outside of your main student plan, you may add an extra module (<em>unidade curricular isolada)</em>.</p>
<p>At UC, student work is graded from 0 to 20, and 9.5 is the pass mark.</p>
<p>Usually UC courses offer two different kinds of assessment:<em> avalia&ccedil;&atilde;o peri&oacute;dica</em> (periodical assessment, i.e., ongoing participation in class with one or two tests and/or essay writing); <em>avalia&ccedil;&atilde;o final</em> (final assessment), i.e., a traditional two-hour long written exam for which you have to use a <em>folha de exame</em> (assessment sheet).</p>

<p>Most examinations require specific exam stationery, which is provided by the faculty. Make sure you know your student/candidate number to identify your script. You must write using blue or black ink and you cannot use any correction fluid, tape or pens to erase what you have written, just cross it out. Listen carefully to the instructions at the start of the examination as the procedure may vary.</p>

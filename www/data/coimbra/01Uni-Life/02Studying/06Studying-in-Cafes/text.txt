<p>UC students spend a lot of time in caf&eacute;s around Coimbra. There are not many places in the world where you can study the whole afternoon for the price of a <em>bica</em> (which is another word for a cup of coffee). Next to the <em>bica</em>, you will see a <em>copo de &aacute;gua</em> (glass of water), books and lots of papers, perhaps a laptop or tablet. So caf&eacute;s in Coimbra are not only places for meeting up your friends, eating and drinking, but also for studying and group work. Just be sensible not to use caf&eacute;s for studying during meal times (lunch or dinner).</p>

<p>When trying to decide where to do your Erasmus, you probably googled &ldquo;University of Coimbra&rdquo; and found the postcard image of Via Latina and Pa&ccedil;o das Escolas. Once in Coimbra, you must have realised that the photo does not do the university full justice, since the modern UC has spread across different parts of the city. The eight UC Schools are now organised into three specialised campuses. </p>
<p>Polo I corresponds largely to the university original site and hosts <a href="http://www.uc.pt/en/fduc"><em>Faculdades do Direito</em></a>, <a href="http://www.uc.pt/en/fluc"><em>de Letras</em></a>, <a href="https://www.uc.pt/fpce"><em>de Psicologia</em> <em>e Ci&ecirc;ncias de Educa&ccedil;&atilde;o</em></a>, as well as some of the departments of the <a href="https://www.uc.pt/en/fctuc/departamentos"><em>Faculdade de Ci&ecirc;ncias e Tecnologia</em></a>. <em>Departamentos de Qu&iacute;mica e F&iacute;sica</em> and <em>Departamento de Matem&aacute;tica</em> are situated along Rua Larga, whereas <em>Departamento de Arquitetura</em> and <em>Departamento de Ci&ecirc;ncias da Vida</em> are lodged in several former Jesuit colleges. </p>
<p>Polo II (das Engenharias, Ci&ecirc;ncias e Tecnologia) is a modern campus to the north of Polo I. Its buildings, which are home to aspiring engineers, geologists and IT specialists, and built by award-winning Portuguese architects. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.uc.pt/en/fmuc"><em>Faculdade de Medicina</em></a> is divided into three different parts. Polo III (<em>das Ci&ecirc;ncias da Sa&uacute;de</em>) is right next to the university hospital complex. Students of medicine, <a href="http://www.uc.pt/ffuc">pharmacy</a> and dentistry have their practical classes, exams and gain job experience in the hospital with its latest medical and laboratorial equipment. </p>
<p>Originally emerging as <em>studium generale - </em>as a medieval university where all four of the &lsquo;highest&rsquo; courses of the time were taught (Theology, Law, Medicine and Arts), UC followed the main trends in European science. <em>Faculdade de Medicina</em> and <em>Faculdade do Direito</em> were the first schools to appear; and <em>Faculdade de Ci&ecirc;ncias e Tecnologia</em> was founded in 1772 in the wake of the Pombaline reforms, which brought scientific revolution into Portugal. The more recent university schools, <a href="https://www.uc.pt/en/feuc"><em>Faculdade de Economia</em></a> and <a href="https://www.uc.pt/en/fcdef"><em>Faculdade de Ci&ecirc;ncias do Desporto e Educa&ccedil;&atilde;o F&iacute;sica</em></a>, were created only after the 1974 Revolution. These schools are not on the main campuses: future economists, diplomats and politicians attend their classes in the prestigious urban district of Olivais. The prospective Olympic champions, coaches and instructors can practice different sports (from handball and tennis to rowing and kayaking) on the university stadium and gym on the left bank of the Mondego river. </p>

<p><em>Jardim Bot&acirc;nico</em> is a hidden gem sitting right next to the University of Coimbra (Polo I): a magnificent botanical garden, perfect for walks and jogs, study and meditation. It's a true museum under the sun dating from the 18<sup>th </sup>century Pombaline reforms, where exotic flora meets the Mediterranean. Its original purpose was to develop natural history studies and knowledge of medicinal plants among the UC community. Now the garden extends over 13 hectares with public and restricted areas. Bamboos and banana trees, azaleas and bougainvilleas - all have their place here. From the meticulously designed central fountain carefully groomed lanes run to the garden corners. If you are a garden lover, you are sure to discover your own favourite spot among its quiet linden alleys, waterlily pools, tropical vegetation area and darkened places formed by meandering ficus roots and vines. You can book a <a href="https://www.uc.pt/en/jardimbotanico/visit">guided tour</a> of the recently restored greenhouse and of the forest section outside the garden walls.</p>

<p><em>Penedo da Saudade </em>is a rocky headland that a legend links with the tragic <a href="http://www.centerofportugal.com/the-tale-of-peter-and-ines">story of forbidden love</a> between the Prince Dom Pedro and In&ecirc;s de Castro, who was lady-in-waiting to his wife Constan&ccedil;a<em>. </em>The distraught Dom Pedro used to come here<em>, </em>to<em> Pedra dos Ventos</em>, to mourn his loss.</p>
<p>Now transformed into a park,<em> Penedo da Saudade </em>has become part of Coimbra&rsquo;s cultural and academic tradition. Sculptures of great literary talents such as Ant&oacute;nio Nobre and E&ccedil;a de Queir&oacute;s stand here. Going down the slope, you will see various stone tablets with poems placed by students to honour different university courses. The <em>Saudade</em> headland with its view over the city roofs sets a melancholic mood. </p>

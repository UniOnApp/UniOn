<p><em>Jardim da Sereia, </em>aka<em> Parque de Santa Cruz, </em>was once a place of meditation and religious reflection. Built in the 18<sup>th</sup> century as part of the Santa Cruz monastery, this park is today one of the green spots in Coimbra centre. </p>
<p>At the park's entrance, you will find three sculptures, three women, three virtues: Hope, Faith and Charity. In the middle of the park -&nbsp; a large fountain with statues that depict Triton, a dolphin and a mermaid (<em>sereia</em>), which give the park its name. From there, staircases decorated with 18<sup>th</sup> century-glazed tiles (<em>azulejo</em>) with exotic animals (among other things) take you up to a round fishpond and further, to the city library and to the Celas area. Good luck guessing which ones are supposed to be elephants or ostriches! The artists were good, but mind you, they were just making do with what they knew.</p>

<p><em>Jardim da Sereia</em> also used to host sports events: a space at its entrance was specifically designed for an outdoor version of real tennis - <em>jeu de longue paume (jogo de p&eacute;la</em>) played by the monks and the town inhabitants.</p>
<p>Nowadays there is still space for all those things in the park: the open space at the entrance is used for fairs and concerts during <em>semana acad&eacute;mica</em> and other cultural events; the tea house is a good place to catch up with friends, and the park lanes are great for jogging and walking. It is also a good place to appreciate contemporary art, see if you can spot it.</p>

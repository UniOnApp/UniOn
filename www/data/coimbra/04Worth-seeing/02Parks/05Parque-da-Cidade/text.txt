<p><em>Parque Dr. Manuel Braga</em>, known as <em>Parque da Cidade </em>is a modern park designed in the 1920s by the landscape architect Jacinto de Matos. An exquisite bandstand in the centre of the park remains from the days when city inhabitants strolled along its lanes to the sound of music. Rows of linden and plane trees offer the desired shadow on hot summer days and invite for a picnic.</p>
<p>Just like any park of classical design, <em>Parque da Cidade</em> has sculptured figures of the renowned scholars and poets Antero de Quental, Manuel Braga, Manuel Alegre and Florbela Espanca.</p>
<p>On the riverside, sits a boat that used to sail the mountain streams. Now permanently ashore, it is part of the Water Museum (<em>Museu da &Aacute;gua</em>) collection.</p>
<p>End of summer is celebrated around the park with an arts and crafts fair, where you can buy anything from a traditional toy to a piece of contemporary art. &nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Col&eacute;gio de S&atilde;o Jer&oacute;nimo</em> (St. Jerome's College) is one of the former Jesuit colleges that has had many uses over its centenary history. Originally designed as a religious building, two centuries later it was transferred to the University of Coimbra, and transformed into the UC hospital in 1848. Nowadays the building houses the International Relations main office (DRI), the UC Museum (<em>Museu Acad&eacute;mico</em>), the Journalism department, and the Centre for Social Studies. Do you want to learn more on the UC academic traditions? Would you like to study at <em>Biblioteca Norte-Sul </em>at CES? Now you know where to head down to. </p>
<p>The famous architect from Asturias <em>Diogo de Castilho</em>, whose magnificent work helped shape the city, designed the college cloister and directed its construction in 1565. Although the baroque style is evident in vaults, columns and capitals of the building, you can spot later additions in other styles, as the college was seriously damaged in the 1755 earthquake. The rococo staircase and the entrance hall decorated with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yjyZ5ReJAeI&amp;feature=youtu.be"><em>azulejo panels</em></a> are the most impressive additions. Probably also because of the earthquake, some of the panels have been redone, and now look like a jumble. See if you can find them in less busy corridors.</p>

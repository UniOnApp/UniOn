<p>The College of Jesus captures in stone the history of the University of Coimbra while illustrating the development of science in Portugal. With the foundations dating from 1542, it is, in fact, the oldest Jesuit college in the world. In the 18<sup>th</sup> century, it became part of the University, and from then on, hosted studies in natural history, mathematics and medicine. The former Jesuit refectory in front of the College was transformed into <a href="https://www.uc.pt/org/historia_ciencia_na_uc/Textos/museu/labchimico"><em>Laboratorio Chimico</em></a> and now houses the main exhibition of the Science <a href="http://www.museudaciencia.org/">Museum</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;The museum has two more spaces in the College you cannot miss: the Physics Gallery, honored by the European Physical Society for the historical interest of its original collection, and the Zoology Gallery, which is a true monument to the 19<sup>th</sup> century natural history exhibitions. Two reputed Italian scholars, Giovanni Dalla Bella and Domenico Vandelli curated both galleries. Vandelli also founded and was the first director of the Botanical Garden in Coimbra.</p>

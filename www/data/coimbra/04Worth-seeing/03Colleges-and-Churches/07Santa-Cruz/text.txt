<p>When strolling through Baixa, it's impossible not to stop and admire Santa Cruz church. Built in 1131, this majestic church owes its name to the Santa Cruz monastery, founded in the reign of Portugal's first king, Dom Afonso Henriques, by a group of twelve Canons Regular of St. Augustine. </p>
<p>Its growing importance throughout history resulted in so many interventions that little remain of the original Romanesque construction, and the present fa&ccedil;ade dates from the early 16<sup>th</sup> century. </p>
<p>Dom Afonso Henriques, who was an ever-present figure in the monastery life, ended up choosing the church space for his burial, as well as his son, Dom Sancho I. For that reason, in 2003, Santa Cruz was recognised as a national pantheon. </p>
<p>If you are not in a hurry, go in and take some time to admire:</p>
<ul>
<li>The interior space, with its imposing vaults and baroque tiles.</li>
<li>The Cloister of Silence, with scenes from the Passion by the French architect Nicolau Chanterenne.</li>

<li>The high choir with its magnificent Manueline chair.</li>

<p><em>S&eacute; Nova, </em>the&nbsp;New Cathedral,&nbsp;is the current&nbsp;bishopric seat of&nbsp;Coimbra and a must see among the historical buildings of UC&rsquo;s Polo I.</p>
<p>Established in 1543 as the church of the&nbsp;Formation house of the Jesuits, a religious order that two centuries later the Marquis of Pombal banned from Portugal.</p>
<p>In 1772, the bishopric seat was transferred from the old&nbsp;Romanesque&nbsp;Cathedral of the city (<em>S&eacute; Velha</em>) to the vacant, spacious and more modern Jesuit church.</p>
<p>The church&rsquo;s fa&ccedil;ade presents four statues of Jesuit saints. The&nbsp;Baroque&nbsp;decoration of its upper part (early 18<sup>th</sup> century), contrasts with the lower part in a rigid&nbsp;Mannerist&nbsp;style.</p>
<p>Once you&rsquo;re inside the barrel-vaulted interior, you can admire the long nave&nbsp;with its several side chapels and a&nbsp;transept&nbsp;with a&nbsp;dome. Stop and take in the exquisite 17<sup>th</sup> and 18<sup>th</sup>-centuries gilt altarpieces in the transept arms and the main chapel.</p>
<p>The choir stalls and the magnificent baptismal stone font,&nbsp;carved in late&nbsp;Gothic-manueline&nbsp;style, were both brought from <em>S&eacute; Velha</em>.</p>
<p><em>S&eacute; Nova </em>plays an important role in academic tradition: this is where students and their families gather in a blessing ceremony that symbolizes the end of their undergrad studies (<em>B&ecirc;n&ccedil;&atilde;o das Pastas</em>). Its patio is also used in special moments in the life of Coimbra students, serving as a stage for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDUVNgp43tQ"><em>Serenata da Latada</em></a><em>,</em> which opens the academic year, and <em>Queima do Grelo</em>, during the May academic week.</p>

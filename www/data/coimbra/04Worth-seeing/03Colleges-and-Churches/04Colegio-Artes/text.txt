<p>Since 2007, <em>Col&eacute;gio das Artes </em>has become part of the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_Coimbra">University of Coimbra</a> dedicated to contemporary art, architecture, film and the performing arts. In the past this college was a pioneering institution, a precursor to the creation of secondary education in Portugal.</p>
<p>King Dom Jo&atilde;o III founded<em> Col&eacute;gio das Artes</em> in 1542 as Col&eacute;gio Real das Artes e Humanidades but it was always known as Col&eacute;gio das Artes. It aimed to prepare future university students in the liberal arts, as until then there were no institutions in Portugal to provide the necessary quality teaching for potential undergraduates and many candidates had to go abroad, mostly to Bordeaux and Paris. </p>
<p>The College opened in 1547, where subjects like theology, church canons and scriptures, grammar, rhetoric, poetry, mathematics, Greek, Hebrew, logic and philosophy were taught. It quickly achieved great prestige, not only in Portugal but across Europe, for the high quality of its courses. Its success encouraged the opening of new colleges in many other cities, which became the forerunners of secondary education in Portugal.</p>
<p>In 1772, the College became part of the University of Coimbra that coordinated all secondary teaching in Portugal. During the Peninsular War, the College of Arts was heavily damaged and looted by both French and British troops and ceased to function in 1837. The newly established <em>Liceu Nacional de Coimbra </em>initially operated in the same building, but then it housed part of the University Hospital and Zoological Museum.</p>

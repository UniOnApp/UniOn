<p><em>S&eacute; Velha</em> (Old Cathedral) is truly unique and extraordinary. Its history is shrouded in mystery, battles and legends.</p>
<p>The cathedral was ordained in 1139 by the first Portuguese king, Afonso Henriques, to dignify Coimbra as the first capital of Portugal. The site housed temples since the Visigoth Kingdom (5-8<sup>th</sup>century), and S&eacute; Velha replaced a previous church. A thousand-year-old olive tree stands witness to the ancient history of the site.</p>
<p>When the cathedral was built, Coimbra had been recently conquered from the Islamic Almoravid Dynasty. The Romanesque S&eacute; Velha is one of the Christian Reconquest era buildings that had least additions in the 16<sup>th</sup> century. Some of the workers and the first count of Coimbra, Sisnando Davides, were Mozarabs educated in Cordoba and Seville, so there are traces of co-habiting with Arab culture in older sections of the cathedral. The geometric and floral motifs on the glazed tiles, the shape of arches and niches remind of the converted Al-Andalus temples in Seville and Alhambra. In fact, if you look closer, you can spot an Arabic inscription next to the Renaissance exterior walls.</p>
<p>From the Almedina arch, the cathedral looks like a small fortress. Legend says it is connected to the former archbishop residence (<a href="http://www.museumachadocastro.gov.pt/en-GB/default.aspx">Museu Nacional Machado de Castro nowadays</a>) by underground tunnels.</p>
<p>S&eacute; Velha&rsquo;s moonlit staircases are the perfect location for the <em>fado</em> Serenata that opens student festivities twice a year. In mid-June, the colourful yearly medieval fair set in the square, brings us back to the past.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This whitewashed building complex surmounted with an impressive early Trinitarian cross has been newly reconstructed to house the European University Judicial Court and <em>Casa de Jurisprud&ecirc;ncia </em>of the UC Law School. Its history began in 1555 when the Most Holy Trinity Order started acquiring buildings along the Coimbra town wall. By the end of that century, the college complex included a church, classrooms and dormitories, and had a passage to <em>Pa&ccedil;o das Escolas</em>. </p>
<p>Over its history, the buildings that once made up <em>Col&eacute;gio da Sant&iacute;ssima Trindade</em> have changed hands and uses while gradually falling into a state of disrepair. The British troops were stationed here during the French invasion in the 1800s. Later it became a woodwork workshop and a tavern popular among the Coimbra students occupied part of the complex. In 1988, the abandoned church collapsed and the whole complex stood in ruins until 2014, when the renovation plans went ahead. </p>
<p>Nowadays, there are three parts to the complex. The main entrance is through the church into the cloister with a balcony. The adjacent building opens into a U-shaped tree-lined green patio that invites to sunbathe. From the balcony, you can enjoy a panoramic view of the city and the Mondego river.</p>

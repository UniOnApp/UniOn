<p>This historic square owes its name to the day in 1834, when liberal troops occupied the city, a few weeks before winning the civil war. </p>
<p>With a modern fountain in the middle the square is enclosed by buildings of the 16<sup>th</sup> and 17<sup>th</sup> centuries. The beautiful <em>Igreja de Santa Cruz</em> along with the iconic caf&eacute; of the same name are a must see.</p>
<p>In the church, one of the National Pantheons, are the tombs of the first two Kings of Portugal.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.cm-coimbra.pt">C&acirc;mara Municipal</a> building closes this square that it is also a stage for celebrations, concerts and political protests.</p>

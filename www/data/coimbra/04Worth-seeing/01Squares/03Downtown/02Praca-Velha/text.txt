<p><em>Pra&ccedil;a do Com&eacute;rcio</em> was once called <em>Pra&ccedil;a de S&atilde;o Bartolomeu</em>, named after the church in one of its ends, and it used to be the location of the main city market. Even today, the Onion Fair and the Antiques Fair are held here.</p>
<p>When the new market was built, <em>Pra&ccedil;a do Com&eacute;rcio</em> became <em>Pra&ccedil;a Velha</em> (old market), as opposed to <em>Pra&ccedil;a Nova</em> (the new Dom Pedro V market).</p>
<p><em>Pra&ccedil;a Velha </em>is still a vibrant place with caf&eacute;s, concerts and lots to discover.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Fun fact:</p>
<p>Many streets where craftsmen worked in the past converge on this square, something that is still evident in their names (<em>Rua das Azeiteiras</em>, Oil-Press St., for example).</p>

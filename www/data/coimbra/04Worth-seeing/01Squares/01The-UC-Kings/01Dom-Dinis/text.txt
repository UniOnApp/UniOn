<p>This monumental statue of King Dom Dinis, by Francisco Franco, one of the main sculptors of Salazar&rsquo;s regime, was state-commissioned when architects Cottinelli Telmo and Cristino da Silva projected the new university campus (1943-1948).</p>
<p>Standing on a high pedestal that rests on a circular base, the university founder's statue shows the austerity and formal rigidity that perfectly represent the official ideology of a dictatorship. That is perhaps why protesting students have often left messages of contestation and resistance messages on the pedestal for the university authorities.</p>
<p>Historical note: </p>
<p>King of Portugal between 1279 and 1325, Dom Dinis was the founder of the General Studies in Lisbon in 1290 (the first Portuguese university school and one of the oldest in the Iberian Peninsula). 18 years later, he transferred the University to Coimbra together with his royal court. So in Coimbra the schooled and the royal traditions lived alongside.</p>

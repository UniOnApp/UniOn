<p>King Dom Jo&atilde;o III&rsquo;s statue (1944), by Francisco Franco, looks like Dom Dinis's twin brother. Both statues are positioned in a special way: the UC founder stands at the entrance to the university campus and King Dom Jo&atilde;o III, who reinstated the UC pride, is placed at its heart, in <em>Pa&ccedil;o das Escolas</em>, where he housed <em>Estudos Gerais</em> in 1537.</p>
<p>The King, a powerful and thoughtful 16<sup>th</sup> century man of culture, appears to be proudly overlooking from his pedestal the transformation of his old Palace into a House of Wisdom. Similarly to Dom Dinis&rsquo; statue, Dom Jo&atilde;o III is on a pedestal. He wields his gloves in his right hand, and a dagger hangs from his waist. Over the King&rsquo;s simple garment is a necklace with the Portuguese Cross of Christ, and a strong ermine cloak that offers volume and boasts his image. </p>

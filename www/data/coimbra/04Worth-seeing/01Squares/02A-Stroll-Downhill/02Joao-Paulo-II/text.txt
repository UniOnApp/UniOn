<p>A monumental bronze statue of John Paul II is standing right in the middle of the roundabout next to <em>Arcos do Jardim.</em> It was designed and erected by Cabral Antunes: the statue represents the pope in papal clothing, raising his arms upwards in expressive acclamation. It stands on a prismatic pedestal of truncated edges, with a staircase base. </p>
<p>The Coimbra City Council commissioned the monument during the visit of the Pope to the city in May 1982. Created by the sculptor for free, the granite pedestal was also an offer from the city of Gouveia. It was inaugurated on May 18<sup>th</sup> 1985.</p>

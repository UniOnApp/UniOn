<p>This 19<sup>th</sup> century sculptural set symbolically represents Lu&iacute;s de Cam&otilde;es, the famous Portuguese epic poet, author of &lsquo;Os Lus&iacute;adas&rsquo;. It was commissioned by the students of the University of Coimbra to commemorate the 300<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the poet&rsquo;s death.</p>
<p>The monument shows a column of Tuscan inspiration, with a laurel crown, resting on a pedestal with a statue of a bronze lion whose four paws are laid on the floor. </p>
<p>This sculpture has travelled a lot around Coimbra, having been dismantled and relocated three times until it found its rightful place here, in 2005.</p>

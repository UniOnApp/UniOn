<p><em>Aqueduto de S&atilde;o Sebasti&atilde;o</em>, also known as <em>Arcos do Jardim </em>('the garden arches&rsquo;), the monument we see today was built at the end of the 16<sup>th</sup> century, on the route, and most likely on the remains of a previous Roman aqueduct. </p>
<p>On the stonework arch of honour, a graceful little temple is decorated with two statues: on top, the martyr St. Sebastian (who gives his name to the aqueduct) and St. Roch, on the bottom. </p>
<p>Fun fact:</p>
<p>According to an old student anecdote, a wild party of students once climbed the aqueduct and removed the guilted arrows from St. Sebastian, leaving a message instead: "<em>Basta de sofrer</em>!" (Stop suffering!) We don't know if the pain ended but it's a fact that, on that aqueduct, a relieved St. Sebastian stands arrowless!</p>

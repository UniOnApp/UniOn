<p>Originally called <em>Pra&ccedil;a Dom Lu&iacute;s</em>, this square was renamed to celebrate the change of political regime in October 1910.</p>
<p>From the University, you go down to <em>Pra&ccedil;a da Rep&uacute;blica,</em> which takes you to the busy city centre. This green square takes up a special place in Coimbra and Portugal&rsquo;s history: many political manifestations and cultural events have set off from here over the years. Student protests and parades for <em>Queima das Fitas</em> and <em>Latada</em>, trade union manifestations and anti-homophobia marches, New Year celebrations, book fairs and crafts exhibitions - all have taken place or flown past <em>Pra&ccedil;a da Rep&uacute;blica</em>. </p>
<p>Lined up with popular bars and caf&eacute;s, with a theatre, a park, a post office, a hostel and two pharmacies, this square buzzes by day and night. It is also a hub for buses and taxis. <em>Pra&ccedil;a da Rep&uacute;blica</em> is so central to people&rsquo;s lives that it is often referred to simply as <em>&lsquo;Pra&ccedil;a&rsquo;. </em></p>
<p>Students of architecture and those who take interest in historical buildings may find houses of different styles around the square, from Art Nouveau to constructivism. Some of the street signs have kept the early 20<sup>th</sup> century design. Can you find them?</p>

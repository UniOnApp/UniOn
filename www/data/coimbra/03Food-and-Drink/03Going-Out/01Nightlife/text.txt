<p>Nightlife in Coimbra is lively and varied, with club and bar owners kept on their toes by a demanding student population. </p>
<p>Head to the bars around S&eacute; Velha where the university fraternity congregates. Bar Quebra Costas is located between the medieval old town and the newer downtown area and borrows the name of the hill that connects them. It has a nice terrace area overlooking the street and a quirky interior. </p>
<p>The ultimate intellectuals venue is <a href="http://www.cafesantacruz.com"><strong>Caf&eacute; Santa Cruz</strong></a> on Pra&ccedil;a 8 de Maio, a converted church vestry dating back centuries. From there, head up Avenida S&aacute; da Bandeira lined with bars and discos. If you just want to sit, relax, and have a drink, go to Pra&ccedil;a (da Rep&uacute;blica) and choose your spot: Tropical, Cartola and Aqui Base Tango are always jam packed with students. </p>
<p>If beer tasting is your thing and you&rsquo;re up for a walk, head to the other side of the river, to Praxis to taste the delights of Coimbra&rsquo;s leading independent brewery and maybe to have a bite.</p>
<p>Cosy restaurants for a romantic meal, intellectuals&rsquo; caf&eacute;s, lively cocktail bars, gastro breweries, jazz and Fado venues, classical music recitals, stage performances, cinema screenings, board game tournaments or pub quizzes &mdash; whatever takes your fancy, it is out there! </p>

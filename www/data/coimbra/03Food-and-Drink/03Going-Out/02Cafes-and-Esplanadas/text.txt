<p>A typical Portuguese day starts and finishes with a <em>cafezinho</em> (espresso). We love our coffee so much that we have coffee at home and then head out to a caf&eacute; just to have another one. True <em>coffeeholics</em>!</p>
<p>Ordering your coffee in Portugal can actually be challenging: you can have &ldquo;<em>um caf&eacute;</em>&rdquo;, which is an espresso (yet may be called&nbsp;<em>bica</em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em>cimbalino</em>, whether you&rsquo;re in the south or the north), &ldquo;<em>um gal&atilde;o</em>&rdquo; (a big caf&eacute; latte); &ldquo;<em>uma meia de leite</em>&rdquo; (a smaller caf&eacute; latte); &ldquo;<em>um garoto</em>&rdquo;, or &ldquo;<em>um pingado</em>&rdquo; (an espresso with a bit of milk), etc.</p>
<p>In daytime there can be students studying for their exams and at night, caf&eacute;s sometimes double as a pub.</p>
<p>Lots of caf&eacute;s and restaurants also have an &ldquo;<em>esplanada</em>&rdquo;, which is basically an outdoor sitting area. In good weather, they are a treat, and there&rsquo;s always one just around the corner. To enjoy your&nbsp;<em>esplanada</em>&nbsp;experience, day or night, just take a seat, have a drink and relax! Sounds quite nice, doesn&rsquo;t it?</p>

<p>When in a different country on a tight budget, every little helps and it&rsquo;s good to know that uni canteens are the cheapest options. With canteens closed or when going to eat out, lunches are usually less expensive than dinners, especially if you opt for a &ldquo;<em>di&aacute;ria</em>&rdquo;, which is the lunch menu with everything included. It can go from &euro;5 up to &euro;8.</p>
<p>There is, however, something you need to know about eating out in Portugal: whatever you eat (whether ordered or not), you are expected to pay for. The moment you seat at a table, waiters often bring bread, olives, cheese or a fish pat&ecirc;, and these are not for free! This appetizer is listed as &ldquo;entradas&rdquo; on the menu and can cost from &euro;1 to &euro;12 per person. If you don&rsquo;t want it, you can send it away and no offense will be taken. </p>
<p>Another thing to keep in mind is that a main dish or &lsquo;<em>dose</em>&rsquo; (portion) is big enough for two or three. In some places you can order a &lsquo;<em>meia-dose</em>&rsquo; (half a portion), be full and save some money!</p>
<p>Tipping is a personal choice but it&rsquo;s common to tip around 10% of the final price if you feel the service was well worth it.</p>

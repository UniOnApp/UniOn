<p>Every university faculty has its own cafeteria. They are a big part of academic life and are usually called &ldquo;bares&rdquo;. They sell coffee, desserts and simple meals throughout the day, but they&rsquo;re also important meeting places for students and staff. In the morning, students go there for a &lsquo;<em>caf&eacute;</em>&rsquo; (espresso) and a &lsquo;<em>torrada</em>&rsquo; (toast) or the irresistible &lsquo;<em>pastel de nata</em>&rsquo; (Portuguese custard tart).</p>
<p>For those in a hurry most faculties have some very handy vending machines, which end up as another socialising spot.</p>

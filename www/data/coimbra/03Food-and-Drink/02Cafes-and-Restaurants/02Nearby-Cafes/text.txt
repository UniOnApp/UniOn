<p>If you&rsquo;re tired of canteen meals, there are plenty of places to choose from around Polo I. You can have lunch in places with history for &euro;5 - &euro;10, and in some of them a panoramic view over the city is included. </p>
<p>For the breath-taking views, go and have a cup of coffee at <a href="http://www.loggia.pt">Loggia</a>, which is part of <em>Museu Machado de Castro,</em> or to <a href="http://www.justicaepaz.com/restaurante-e-bar.php"><em>Justi&ccedil;a e Paz</em></a> side by side with the Botanical Garden. At <em>Justi&ccedil;a e Paz</em>, Portuguese traditional meals are served. There is ample space for studying and free wi-fi. It is open till 11.30 pm and also on Saturdays.</p>

<p>Coimbra&rsquo;s culinary scene keeps changing. Your first contact with Portuguese cuisine could be at one of the Uni canteens or restaurants, where you can taste some typical dishes. In town, you can easily find food to every taste and every budget. New fads and fashions come and go, yet <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RPD4AnLj048">tradition</a> persists: old <em>tascas </em>and<em> tabernas, caf&eacute;s </em>and<em> pastelarias</em> sit side by side with sushi spots, kebab and hamburger places. </p>
<p>There are lots of places for drinking and partying around, some of them Erasmus partners. Have fun!</p>

<p>This is the cheapest way to get a hot meal on campus, as well as to experience Portuguese cuisine firsthand, from <em>bacalhau</em> dishes to <em>roj&otilde;es</em>. Do not be surprised if you get two carbs - both potatoes and rice - on your plate. Also, soup is served at lunch and dinner. If you think portions are huge, ask for a smaller portion and engage with the ongoing campaign against food waste. </p>
<p>Most canteens open Monday to Friday for lunch from 12 to 3pm, providing meat, fish and vegetarian options. There is also a pizza/pasta place (<em>Monumentais</em>) and a sandwich bar at Polo I (<em>Sala A-Cantinas</em> <em>Azuis</em>). If you feel like having something different from the usual Portuguese breakfast - coffee and bread roll -, the <em>Qu&iacute;micas</em> canteen usually serve a continental breakfast. <em>Sala A </em>(<em>Cantinas Azuis</em>) and <em>Monumentais</em> are open daily for dinner, while <em>Azuis</em> is the only canteen working at weekends.

<p>Prices range from &euro;1.50 for a pizza slice at <em>Monumentais </em>to &euro;2.40 for a &lsquo;social&rsquo; meal. Despite its name, &lsquo;<em>servi&ccedil;o snack&rsquo;</em> means a more elaborate and expensive meal that can go up to &euro;4. You can order a diet meal 24 hours beforehand, online and over the phone.</p>

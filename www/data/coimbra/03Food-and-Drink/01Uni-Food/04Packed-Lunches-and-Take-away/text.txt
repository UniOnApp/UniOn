<p>Lunch break at the UC usually lasts around an hour. Some students, professors and university staff leave their workplaces and eat at home, others - on campus. People get together over lunch at cafeterias and socialize. At canteens and university cafeterias you can see some students eating their packed or take away lunches and others having a canteen meal. Yet, bringing your own food is not enacouraged at caf&eacute;s and restaurants on the campus. </p>

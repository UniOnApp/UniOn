<p>Portuguese cuisine is Mediterranean with olive oil, garlic and herbs as staples. From the 15th-16th century contact with West Africa and India, its culinary tradition borrowed <em>piripiri (</em>hot chili), cinnamon, cumin, coriander and other spices. <em>Bacalhau </em>(salted and dried cod) is an icon and it is said to be a recipe for each day of the week.</p>
<p>In summer, restaurants serve charcoal-grilled fresh sardines, mackerel and seafood.&nbsp; They are delicious! </p>
<p>Lamb, kid and beef are important regional meat dishes, yet pork is served across the country - fresh, cured or smoked or as an ingredient in <em>chouri&ccedil;o</em>, <em>morcela </em>(black pudding), <em>farinheira</em> (made with flour, fat and seasoning), etc.</p>
<p>Medieval inspired Portuguese sweet treats (<em>Do&ccedil;aria Conventual)</em> are egg-based, very sweet, often with almonds and cinnamon. Their names evoke Christian symbolism: <em>papos de anjo, barrigas de freira, pudim de Abade de Priscos</em>. Every region of Portugal claims its own signature pastry: &lsquo;<em>past&eacute;is de Bel&eacute;m</em>&rsquo; in Lisbon, <em>&lsquo;ovos moles&rsquo;</em> in Aveiro, or <em>arrufadas</em> and <em>past&eacute;is de Tent&uacute;gal </em>in the Coimbra region. Carob and almond pastries in southern Algarve remind us of the Arab presence in the 8th-13th centuries.</p>
<p>Christmas is dangerous for anyone with a sweet tooth - so many cakes, desserts and puddings to choose from! Its highlight, <em>Bolo Rei </em>(King Cake), named after the Biblical three kings, looks like a crown covered with candied and dried fruit. </p>
<p>In the past 15 years, <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/travel/article/portugal-food/index.html">Portuguese cuisine</a> has taken in produce and techniques from other culinary traditions, which makes it even more innovative. </p>

<p>Big or small, there are many supermarkets to choose from in Coimbra!</p>
<p>You can find <a href="http://www.continente.pt"><em>Continente</em></a> both in Coimbra Shopping and in Forum (a shopping centre on the left bank of the river Mondego) and <a href="http://www.jumbo.pt/Frontoffice/"><em>Jumbo</em></a> (with the largest selection of world foods) in Alma Shopping. All of these have extended opening hours, usually from 8.30am to 10pm (Sundays), 11pm (Mon-Thu) or midnight (Fri, Sat and before a holiday).</p>
<p><a href="http://www.pingodoce.pt"><em>Pingo Doce</em></a> supermarkets are smaller, but have a nice selection of fresh products and all the household items you&rsquo;ll need.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.aldi.pt"><em>Aldi</em></a> and <a href="https://www.lidl.pt"><em>Lidl</em></a>, the affordable German supermarket chains, are also in town. For fancier produce (and more expensive), there&rsquo;s a <a href="https://www.tiendeo.pt/coimbra/supercor"><em>Supercor</em></a> not too far from the Cidade de Coimbra Stadium.</p>

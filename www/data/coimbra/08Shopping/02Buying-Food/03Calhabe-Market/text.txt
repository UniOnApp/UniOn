<p><strong>Mercado do Calhab&eacute;</strong></p>
<p>Calhab&eacute; used to be a relatively poor rural area in the Coimbra outskirts. Some say that the name&rsquo;s origin is a family name &ldquo;<em>Calhab&eacute;u</em>&rdquo;; others, a tavern serving drinks that &ldquo;<em>calham bem</em>&rdquo; for students (fit students&rsquo; wishes); finally, that it acknowledges the neighbourhood&rsquo;s useful location (&ldquo;<em>calha bem</em>&rdquo;). Alongside wealthy mansions and <em>quintas</em> there were houses of people who worked in fields, factories and small shops nearby.</p>
<p>In 1942, a market opened for the Calhab&eacute; community to get/sell foodstuffs, flowers and other products for daily needs. It was (and still is) a place for traditional celebrations and festivals, especially for &ldquo;Santos Populares&rdquo; (S&atilde;o Pedro, S&atilde;o Jo&atilde;o and Santo Ant&oacute;nio). In June, the smell of grilled sardines invites everyone to a dance and a song around the St. John&rsquo; s bonfires.</p>
<p>Mercado do Calhab&eacute; opens at weekends in the morning.</p>

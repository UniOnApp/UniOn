<p>Coimbra&rsquo;s municipal market was first built as an open market in 1868 in the place of Santa Cruz monastery&rsquo;s vegetable garden and merged three older markets previously situated in Largo da Santa Cruz, Pra&ccedil;a do Com&eacute;rcio and Largo da S&eacute; Nova. Later walled up and roofed, it has maintained the fish market in the same space where you can find it today since 1917. The ample multi-storeyed <a href="http://mercados.cm-coimbra.pt/portal/alias__MMDPV/lang__pt-PT/tabID__119/FirstChild__-1/DesktopDefault.aspx">building</a> you see now dates from 2001.</p>
<p>The market opens every day until about 3pm (except for Sundays). The biggest and most colourful display is on Saturdays. Farmers, large sellers and customers flood in from Coimbra and the outskirts, so the three parking lots may become completely full. The market is adapted for people with mobility impairments, and public transport is available close by.</p>
<p>Seasonal fruits, greens, flower and vegetable stalls, butchers and fishmongers shops are lined up on the ground flour. The first floor is given mostly to freshly baked bread, pastry and different sorts of cottage and mature cheese. If you get peckish seeing all that food around you, there&rsquo;s a little caf&eacute; at the entrance level. Some sellers are happy to give you a chance to try their goods.</p>

<p><em>Mercadinho do Bot&acirc;nico</em> opened in Coimbra in 2004. Passing by the Botanical garden on a Saturday morning (10am-2pm), you&rsquo;ll be surprised to find a little farmer&rsquo;s market spread in a botanical garden; and you can also stop and talk to the vendors, have a taste of locally produced food, and even share cooking and gardening tips. Seasonal vegetables and fruits, pulses and grains, nuts and many other things are sold here. Farmers bring a variety of foodstuffs made through sustainable agriculture: aromatic olive oil, home-baked bread and biscuits, fresh cheese, honey and jam.</p>
<p><em>Mercadinho</em> has grown out of the local &lsquo;slow food&rsquo; and permaculture movements whose members want to promote ecological awareness in the society. Apart from selling organic produce, they arrange weekly delivery of seasonal <a href="https://www.facebook.com/verdejar.agriculturabiologica/">baskets</a> (<em>cabaz semanal</em>), organize workshops and seminars on healthy food and sustainable agriculture, and give out seedlings.</p>

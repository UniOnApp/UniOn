<p>Foodstuffs for different kinds of special diets (e.g. gluten, lactose, and sugar-free, etc.) are easy to find: every supermarket has nowadays a special section with these products (&ldquo;<em>diet&eacute;ticos</em>&rdquo;). You can also find them across the main sections.</p>
<p>Once in a supermarket, check the colour-coding on the supermarket's own brand packages (e.g. Continente) - they indicate the percentage of sugar, saturated fat, salt, cholesterol and calories of the product in relation to the recommended for healthy diets. So, green is safe and watch out for those yellow and red marks!</p>
<p>National celiac, diabetes and other associations regularly review food products and certify them.&nbsp; For example, on the certified gluten-free products, you can find the logo and letters APC (<a href="https://www.celiacos.org.pt/tourism.html">Associa&ccedil;&atilde;o Portuguesa de Cel&iacute;acos</a>). If you&rsquo;re an association member, you can get access to discounts and promotional campaigns on special foodstuffs, as well as to lists of certified products.</p>
<p>There are also special health food shops: <a href="https://www.celeiro.pt/produtos/alimentacao/">Celeiro</a> in Alma Shopping and F&oacute;rum, and <a href="https://www.facebook.com/Bioescolha?fref=ts">Bioescolha</a> in Celas.</p>

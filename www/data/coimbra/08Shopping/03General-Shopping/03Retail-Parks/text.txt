<p>Not too far from the city are two retail parks: <a href="http://www.coimbraretailpark.pt">Coimbra Retail Park</a>, in Eiras and a bit further out <a href="http://www.parquemondego.com">Parque Mondego Retail Park</a>, in Taveiro. Both have big box&nbsp;retailers with common features: cheaper prices and frequent bargains (&ldquo;<em>pechinchas&rdquo;</em>). From household items to sportswear or electronic appliances, there are always good deals for everyone. Just go to the <a href="http://www.smtuc.pt">SMTUC</a> (Coimbra bus services website) to plan your bus trip and enjoy your shopping spree!</p>

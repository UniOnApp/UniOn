<p>If you enjoy window-shopping, need some retail therapy, or you actually have to buy a few things, Coimbra has some <em>&lsquo;centros comerciais&rsquo;</em> (shopping centres) for you to discover.</p>
<p>The bigger ones are <a href="http://www.almashopping.pt">Alma Shopping</a> (next to the Cidade de Coimbra Stadium), <a href="http://www.forum-coimbra.com">Forum</a> (on the left bank of the river Mondego) and <a href="http://www.coimbrashopping.pt">Coimbra Shopping</a> (in the Vale das Flores area). They all have supermarkets, food-courts, a nice range of national and international clothes and shoe brands, and shops that you&rsquo;ll probably be familiar with.</p>

<p>Just like every other historic city, Coimbra combines the best of both worlds: traditions and rituals of a medieval town with the recent trends common across Europe. Quirky historic fairs (<em>Feira dos L&aacute;zaros</em>, <em>Feira das Cebolas</em>, etc.) liven up the city streets year round, while contemporary fairs are organised: flea and curiosity markets, fairs of vinyl, of urban crafts'. Traditional farmer markets continue to work alongside a permaculture market, whereas new supermarkets appear here and there.</p>
<p>Decades ago, Coimbra downtown was a must for those who needed new clothes and shoes; now it seems to attract more tourists than locals who prefer shopping centres, outlets and buying online. Once you manage to see past the souvenir displays, prepare to be surprised as you discover the true pace of the city.</p>

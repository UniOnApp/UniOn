<p>Looking for a bargain? Have an eye for a good deal? Love vintage? Then this info is for you, as there&rsquo;s a street market (or even two) each Saturday.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Feira do Bairro:</strong></p>
<p>Every Saturday morning, stalls are put up for clothes, shoes, bags and other accessories in Bairro Norton de Matos, in a parking lot between Rua Carlos Seixas and Rua Paulo Quintela (in front of the firefighters&rsquo; brigade).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Feira sem Regras:</strong></p>
<p>Every 1st Saturday, a garage sale is on in the square in front of the Santa Clara-a-Velha Convent (9am - 6 pm (winter) or 10am - 10 pm (summer).</p>
<p>As the urban legend has it, the Feira sem Regras owes its name to Avenida Jo&atilde;o das Regras, and is meant as a tease: anyone who is not professional vendor can bring things for sale (hence <em>&ldquo;sem regras&rdquo;</em> - &ldquo;no rules&rdquo;). So you can find almost anything here, from second hand clothing and shoes to vinyl, furniture, antiques and hand-made creations. Anything goes.</p>

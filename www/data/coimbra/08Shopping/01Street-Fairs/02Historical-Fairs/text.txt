<p>Coimbra is an historic city and you can experience it first-hand. Throughout the year, several days transport you straight into the medieval Coimbra, with folk dancing and singing, traditional games and crafts:</p>
<p><br /> March-April</p>
<p><em>Feira dos L&aacute;zaros</em> is a curious event, for<em> &ldquo;L&aacute;zaro/s&rdquo;</em> in Coimbra is linked to four different things: a saint, a hospital, a sick person, and a traditional pastry. Surprised? See for yourself. First, the fair takes place two weeks before Easter on a Sunday in commemoration of the Raising of Lazarus. Second, Feira dos L&aacute;zaros is held on one of the sites where a leper hospital (<em>Hospital dos L&aacute;zaros</em>) in Coimbra used to work for over 7 centuries (1210-1961). The ruins of the first building (in use until 1836) can still be seen in Azinhaga dos L&aacute;zaros, in a parking lot not far from Coimbra bus terminal. The fair takes place on the hospital&rsquo;s last site - Largo Dom Dinis - where the Mathematics Department is now located. Finally, Feira dos L&aacute;zaros catered for the Coimbra families who, before going to the hospital to visit their &ldquo;l&aacute;zaros&rdquo; (leper patients), used to buy food, sweets and toys at the fair. The most traditional food at Feira dos L&aacute;zaros is <em>manjar branco</em> (rice pudding with chicken breast served on a clay disc) and &ldquo;l&aacute;zaros&rdquo;, which are chicken-shaped sourdough buns decorated with feathers.</p>
<p>So, that&rsquo;s four &ldquo;l&aacute;zaros&rdquo; in one fair!</p>
<p><br />June</p>
<p>Every mid-June you can travel back to the medieval era without having to find a time machine or leaving Coimbra. Set off with a medieval evening banquet fit for a king, the fair showcases, for two-three days, the traditional crafts, games and pastimes that have survived throughout centuries. You can see how blacksmiths, weavers, coopers and potters work; seek a potion from a herbalist; buy freshly baked corn and wheat bread; feast on grilled meat and wine; mingle with the costumed crowd, buskers, beggars, jesters and street performers; watch knight tournaments and medieval dances and a puppet theatre. You won&rsquo;t be bored, that&rsquo;s for sure!</p>
<p><br /> August</p>
<p>Once the crops are harvested, another historic fair is on at Coimbra&rsquo;s Pra&ccedil;a Velha/Pra&ccedil;a do Com&eacute;rcio, - <em>Feira das Cebolas</em> (Onion Fair). And it&rsquo;s not only about selling onions, even though they look cool braided, and you can learn to do it. For a whole week, visitors and passers-by can taste the traditional cuisine and pastry (e.g. sticky sweet <em>escarpeadas</em>), take part in folk dances and games, and watch the ritual of selling onion braids. Folk groups from across the country come to Coimbra, so you can take in the differences in costumes and customs. On the last night, the vibrant fair quietens down, and a fado performance starts.</p>

Coimbra is an in-betweener, both geographically and historically. It comes fourth in terms of population

and area after Lisboa, Porto and Braga. If you look at the map of Portugal, you see Coimbra in the centre

of the country and its great location to get train and bus connections to other cities in Portugal, as well

as to other countries. Also, Coimbra stands on the bank of the Mondego river that flows all the way from

the Serra de Estrela mountains to Figueira da Foz on the ocean side. Despite being partly navigable,

Mondego is only used for recreation and sports activities.<br>

Within the city, bus lines run between Alta and Baixa and away into the city outskirts. Coimbra boasts

the only trolleybus system in Portugal and on Iberian Peninsula. This hilly city is also great for power

walkers, climbers and radical cyclists.

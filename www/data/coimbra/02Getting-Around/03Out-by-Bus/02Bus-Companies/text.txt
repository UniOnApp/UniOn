<p>In Portugal, there are two major coach companies: Rede Expressos and Transdev. Their intercity coaches depart and arrive from the Terminal Rodovi&aacute;rio on Avenida Fern&atilde;o Magalh&atilde;es, a 5 min-walk from Esta&ccedil;&atilde;o Velha (Coimbra-B railway station). </p>
<p>Companies like Rodonorte, Joalto and Mois&eacute;s have their stops close to Esta&ccedil;&atilde;o Nova (Coimbra-A railway station) in the city centre on the river bank. Some buses to Coimbra outskirts also depart from those stops. With some planning and practice, you will be able to find the ticket office and stop for your destination.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Coimbra&rsquo;s main bus terminal (<em>Terminal Rodovi&aacute;rio</em>) is located at Avenida Fern&atilde;o de Magalh&atilde;es, halfway (about 10-15 minutes' walk) between Esta&ccedil;&atilde;o Nova at the heart of the city and Esta&ccedil;&atilde;o Velha in the city outskirts. Most intercity and some international coach lines stop here - Transdev, CitiExpress, Rede Expressos, Eurolines.&nbsp; There is a ticket office in case of emergency, but to be on the safe side check out intercity itineraries and timetables, and buy tickets <a href="http://www.rede-expressos.pt/default.aspx">online</a> (English and French versions are available). </p>

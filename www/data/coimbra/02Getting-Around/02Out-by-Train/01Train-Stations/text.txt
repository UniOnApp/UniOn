<p>Coimbra-B, locally known as &lsquo;<em>Esta&ccedil;&atilde;o Velha&rsquo;</em>, welcomes you to the city if you come by train. Every type of <a href="https://www.cp.pt/passageiros/en/train-times/Stations">train</a> (<em>Alfa, Intercidades, Regional, Suburbano, Internacional</em>) stops and departs from here, but be warned: you are 1km away from the city centre! Fortunately, your ticket includes a five-minute-train ride to Coimbra-A, or &lsquo;<em>Esta&ccedil;&atilde;o Nova&rsquo;</em>, located at the heart of <em>Baixa</em>. This station was built between 1925 and 1931 and was classified as a &lsquo;Monument of Public Interest&rsquo; by the Portuguese government. Coimbra-A is mainly a connection to Coimbra-B, but there are a few trains that depart directly from here. Both stations have taxi ranks and bus stops nearby.</p>

<p>Even if you&rsquo;re fond of walking, in the hilly Coimbra you are better off taking a bus. It is a reliable transport once you&rsquo;ve learned to check the concrete route and <a href="http://www.smtuc.pt/geral/index_horarios.php">timetable</a>s. The return route may not be the same! With practice, you will soon be able to <a href="http://www.smtuc.pt/geral/index_itinerarios.php">distinguish</a> between n.24 and n.24T, n.5 and n.5T, and realize that T may stand for different things... </p>
<p>Bus drivers usually comply with the timetable, but the times indicated on the bus stop refer only to the terminal stops. So you&rsquo;re supposed to calculate how long the bus takes to your stop. Luckily, there is an app that traces buses in real time - <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.bustuc">BusTUC</a>.</p>

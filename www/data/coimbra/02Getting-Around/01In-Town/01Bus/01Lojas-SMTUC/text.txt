<p>The beginning of each month is the busiest time, so make sure you have topped up your card to avoid the queues of people buying and renewing their monthly passes. Other authorised spots for topping up your card are listed on the <a href="http://www.smtuc.pt/geral/index.php">SMTUC</a> website (look for &lsquo;<a href="http://www.smtuc.pt/postos/index.php"><em>Locais de Venda</em></a>&rsquo;)</p>

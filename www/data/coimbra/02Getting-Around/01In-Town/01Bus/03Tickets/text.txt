<p>Go to <a href="http://www.smtuc.pt/postos/index.php">Lojas SMTUC</a> to buy a new bus card <em>bilhete pr&eacute;-comprado</em> &ldquo;Viagem conVIDA&rdquo;, or to top it up. Mind you, on-board tickets are almost twice as expensive. As a university student (up to 25 years old), you are eligible for a <a href="http://www.smtuc.pt/geral/index_precos.php">student pass</a> - you need a valid ID and a UC <em>matr&iacute;cula</em>.</p>
<p>The top-up card can also be used to take <a href="http://www.smtuc.pt/servicos/index_elevador.php"><em>Elevador do Mercado</em></a>. It is very handy to get to the Polo I campus, or to the Coimbra municipal market and all the bars along Avenida S&aacute; da Bandeira as it spares your time and effort of going up and down the streets. The same card is valid for journeys on electric shuttle buses that circulate between Portagem and S&eacute; Velha (<a href="http://www.smtuc.pt/servicos/index_linha_azul.php">Linha Azul</a>), and from downtown to the UC through the Botanical garden (<a href="http://www.smtuc.pt/avisos/index.php?id=915">Linha do Bot&acirc;nico</a>). </p>

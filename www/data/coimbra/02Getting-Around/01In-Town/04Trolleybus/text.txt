<p>Spot the trolleybus antennas on the streets, and you know you&rsquo;re in Coimbra. In fact, the city has long been one of the few and nowadays the only one in the Iberian Peninsula where <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4FPVIfCQ9Io">trolleybuses</a> still run. They came to complement the existing tram lines and ended up replacing them - the whole downtown was once crisscrossed by their railways.</p>
<p>There are two trolleybus lines: 4 and 103, which pass Polo I. They <a href="http://www.smtuc.pt/geral/index_horarios.php">circulate</a> between Esta&ccedil;&atilde;o Coimbra-A and Santo Ant&oacute;nio dos Olivais, and n.103 stops at Rua Larga.</p>
